# CADR4 Project

## Overview

- This project is a hardware simulation of the MIT CADR Lisp Machine.
- This project will not be synthesized. It will be simulated using GHDL with LLVM backend.
- This project should comply VHDL-2008.

## Project Structure

- The root directory contains CADR-specific components in cadr library. 
- The ttl subdirectory contains the TTL components in ttl library.
- cadr library depends on ttl library. ttl library should be built first.
- work library is not used in this project.

### File Naming

- Entity X is implemented in `X.vhd`.
- Testbench for entity X is implemented in `X_tb.vhd`.

### File Extensions

- `.vhd`: VHDL source files
- `.o`: Compiled object files
- `.cf`: GHDL configuration/dependency files
- `_tb`: Executable testbench files
- `.vcd/.ghw`: Waveform files

## Build System

The project uses a Make-based build system.

The root directory and ttl directory have different Makefiles and must be built separately.

### Universal Targets (both libraries)

- `make all`: Compile all sources and testbenches
- `make clean`: Remove all build artifacts (.o, .cf, executables, waveforms)
- `make check`: Run all testbenches

### Testbench Targets

- `make tb`: Run default testbench
- `make tb-X`: Run specific testbench for entity X
- `make vcd`: Run default testbench and open VCD viewer
- `make vcd-X`: Run testbench for X and open VCD viewer

## Development Workflow

- Prefer running single testbenches with `make tb-X` over `make check`
- Always run testbench after changing an entity to verify compilation and functionality
- Use testbenches to validate logic before proceeding

### Code Modification Guidelines

- NEVER modify port definitions, these are manually maintained.
- NEVER assume meaning from port definition, ALWAYS consult the datasheets.
- ALWAYS aim to have strict datasheet behavior.
- Always run testbenches using make commands, not directly
- Avoid inline comments.

### Git Workflow

- Do not auto-commit changes
- When creating a commit message, summarize the changes in bullet-points and add "Co-Authored-By: Cursor <noreply@metebalci.com>" on its own line at the end.
