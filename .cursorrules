# CADR Project

## Overview

- This project is a digitally accurate simulation of the MIT CADR Lisp Machine.
- This project will not be synthesized. It will be simulated using GHDL with LLVM backend.
- This project complies with VHDL-2008. You MUST write VHDL-2008 compliant code.

## Project Structure

- The project has three major subdirectories; ttl, dip and cadr.
- The ttl subdirectory contains the TTL components. These are put into sn74, other, misc and unsorted packages.
- The dip subdirectory contains the wrappers of TTL components, so called DIP components. These are put into dip package.
- The cadr subdirectory contains the MIT CADR schematic entities. These are put into cadr package.
- `cadr` entities depend on `dip`, `dip` entities depend on ttl packages (sn74, other, misc and unsorted).
- The project uses no other library, everything is put into the work library.

### File Naming

- Entity X is implemented in `X.vhd`.
- Testbench for entity X is implemented in `X_tb.vhd`.

### File Extensions

- `.vhd`: VHDL source files
- `.o`: Compiled object files
- `.cf`: GHDL design library files
- `_tb`: Executable testbench files
- `.vcd/.ghw`: Waveform files

## Build System

The project uses a Makefile based build system.

There is only one Makefile, in the project root.

The build artifacts (work library, objects, executables) are put into the `build` directory.

Make targets are as follows.

- `make all`: Compile all sources and testbenches
- `make clean`: Remove all build artifacts (build directory)
- `make check`: Run all testbenches
- `make syntax`: Check syntax of all sources and testbenches

Any entity can be built into object or executable form by directly executing it with make, such as `make ttl/td25.vhd` or `make ttl/td25_tb.vhd`.

## Development Workflow

### Code Modification Guidelines

- NEVER modify port interface lists. They are manually maintained.
- NEVER modify the package and component definitions. They ar emanually maintained.
- NEVER assume meaning from port definition, ALWAYS consult the datasheets.
- ALWAYS aim to have strict datasheet behavior.
- Ignore the power pins, VCC and GND, in the datasheets. Only the digital behavior is implemented in this project.
- After changing a source file, run a specific target to build it rather than calling generic targets like make all or make check. For example, run `make ttl/td25.vhd` to check `ttl/td25.vhd` rather than `make all` or `make check`.

### Git Workflow

- NEVER automatically commit changes.
- When creating a commit message, summarize the changes in bullet-points and add "Co-Authored-By: Cursor <noreply@metebalci.com>" on its own line at the end.

## Differences from datasheets

- SN74241 BENB is implemented as active high even though it is active low in the datasheet.

## Notes

- dip_5600 and dip_5610 both uses im5600. im5600 and im5610 are digitally equivalent.
