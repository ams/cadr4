# cadr/README.md

This folder contains cadr components.

A cadr component implements a CADR schematic page and named
accordingly as cadr_<PAGE>.  The cadr components are grouped into two
packages `cadr_book` and `icmem_book`.

The suds architecture of cadr components are auto-generated from
`doc/ai/cadr/*.drw` files.  The architecture is implemented in
cadr_<PAGE>_suds.vhd files.
