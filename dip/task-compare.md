dip package defined in dip/dip.vhd has dip_X entities which are basically a wrapper for ttl entities defined under ttl folder. Each component in dip/dip.vhd has comments saying which entity it wraps, and which pin maps to which port name of the entity. Cross check this with the comments in ttl/*.vhd files and report your findings in the Report section below.

Do not modify any code.

## Non-Standard and Passive Components

The following components are defined in `dip/dip.vhd` but do not map to standard TTL logic components in the `ttl` library. They represent dummy components, resistors, or other special hardware. Their VHDL models in the `ttl` directory are simplified and there are no port mapping conflicts to report.

- `dip_16dummy`
- `dip_res20`
- `dip_sip220_330_8`
- `dip_sip330_470_8`
- `dip_td100`
- `dip_td25`
- `dip_td250`
- `dip_td50`
- `dip_til309`

## Mismatch Details

### 1. `dip_74ls14`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_74ls14` has the following mapping for pin `p8`:

```vhdl
p8  : out std_logic;                -- g4q
```

However, the entity `sn7414` in `ttl/sn7414.vhd` defines this port as `g4q_n`:

```vhdl
g4q_n : out std_logic;
```

The port name in the `dip/dip.vhd` comment is incorrect. It should be `g4q_n`.

### 2. `dip_7428`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_7428` has the following mapping for pin `p6`:

```vhdl
p6  : in  std_logic;                -- g3b
```

Looking at the `sn7428` entity in `ttl/sn7428.vhd` and the pinout for a 7428 device, pin `p6` should correspond to `g2b`, not `g3b`. The entity `sn7428` has a `g2b` port. The comment in `dip/dip.vhd` is incorrect.

### 3. `dip_74s04`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_74s04` has the following mapping for pin `p8`:

```vhdl
p8  : out std_logic;                -- g4q
```

However, the entity `sn7404` in `ttl/sn7404.vhd` defines this port as `g4q_n`:

```vhdl
g4q_n : out std_logic;
```

The port name in the `dip/dip.vhd` comment is incorrect. It should be `g4q_n`.

### 4. `dip_74s11`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_74s11` has inverted output ports (`g1y_n`, `g2y_n`, `g3y_n`). However, the `sn7411` entity in `ttl/sn7411.vhd` has non-inverted output ports (`g1y`, `g2y`, `g3y`). The port names in the `dip/dip.vhd` comments are incorrect.

### 5. `dip_74s11o`

This component is defined with `inout` ports and does not have port mappings in the comments. The corresponding `ttl` entity `sn7411` does not have `inout` ports. This appears to be a special case for an open-collector version of the `sn7411` and is marked as a mismatch.

### 6. `dip_74s133`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_74s133` has the port `q_n` defined as an `in` port. However, the `sn74133` entity in `ttl/sn74133.vhd` defines `q_n` as an `out` port. The direction of the port is incorrect in `dip/dip.vhd`.

### 7. `dip_74s153`

The `ttl/sn74153.vhd` file has a VHDL error. The architecture references signals `i0` through `i7` which are not defined as ports in the entity. This file will not compile.

### 8. `dip_74s174`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_74s174` has its output ports `q1` through `q6` defined as `in` ports. The `sn74174` entity in `ttl/sn74174.vhd` defines them as `out` ports. The direction of these ports is incorrect in `dip/dip.vhd`.

### 9. `dip_74s182`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_74s182` has ports `x3` and `y3` defined as `out` ports. The `sn74182` entity in `ttl/sn74182.vhd` defines them as `in` ports. The direction of these ports is incorrect in `dip/dip.vhd`.

### 10. `dip_74s20o`

This component is defined with `inout` ports and does not have port mappings in the comments. The corresponding `ttl` entity `sn7420` does not have `inout` ports. This appears to be a special case for an open-collector version of the `sn7420` and is marked as a mismatch.

### 11. `dip_74s260`

The port names in the `dip_74s260` component in `dip/dip.vhd` are completely different from the port names in the `sn74260` entity in `ttl/sn74260.vhd`. The `dip` component has ports `i1`-`i5` and `o1`, while the `ttl` entity has `g1a`-`g5a`, `g1y_n`, `g1b`-`g5b`, and `g2y_n`.

### 12. `dip_74s472`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_74s472` has its data ports `d0` through `d7` defined as `in` ports. The `dm74472` entity in `ttl/dm74472.vhd` defines them as `out` ports. The direction of these ports is incorrect in `dip/dip.vhd`.

### 13. `dip_9328`

In `dip/dip.vhd`, the component `dip_9328` has all its ports defined as `in`. However, the `dm9328` entity in `ttl/dm9328.vhd` defines `aq`, `aq_n`, `bq`, and `bq_n` as `out` ports. The direction of these ports is incorrect in `dip/dip.vhd`.

## Project Rules Contradiction

The project rule states: `SN74241 BENB is implemented as active high even though it is active low in the datasheet.`

My investigation shows:
- The `ttl/sn74241.vhd` file implements `benb` as active high.
- The comment in `ttl/sn74241.vhd` says: `-- In the TI datasheet of SN74LS241, BENB (2G) is active high.`
- The TI datasheet for `SN74LS241` confirms that the `2G` input (pin 19, which is `benb`) is indeed active high.

The project rule appears to be incorrect. The implementation correctly follows the datasheet.
