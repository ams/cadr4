# Am25LS2519

Quad Register with Two Independently Controlled Three-State Outputs

### DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS

- Two sets of fully buffered three-state outputs
- Four D-type flip-flops ٠
- Polarity control on W outputs .
- Buffered common clock enable .

- · Buffered common asynchronous clear
- Separate buffered common output enable for each set of outputs

### GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Am25LS2519 consists of four D-type flip-flops with a buffered common clock enable. Information meeting the set-up and hold time requirements on the D inputs is transferred to the flip-flop outputs on the LOW-to-HIGH transition of the clock. Data on the Q outputs of the flipflops is enabled at the three-state outputs when the output control (OE) input is LOW. When the appropriate OE input is HIGH, the outputs are in the high impedance state. Two independent sets of outputs –  $W$  and  $Y$  – are provided such

that the register can simultaneously and independently drive two buses. One set of outputs contains a polarity control such that the outputs can either be inverting or noninverting.

The device also features an active LOW asynchronous clear. When the clear input is LOW, the Q output of the internal flip-flops are forced LOW independent of the other inputs. The Am25LS2519 is packaged in a space saving (0.3-inch row spacing) 20-pin package.

Image /page/0/Figure/15 description: The image shows a block diagram of an electronic circuit, along with a table of related products. The block diagram consists of several logic gates and flip-flops, interconnected to perform a specific function. The diagram includes labels such as 'ENABLE', 'CLOCK', 'CLEAR', and 'POLARITY', indicating the different control signals. The table lists two part numbers, 'Am25S18, Am2918' and 'Am25LS2518', along with their corresponding descriptions, 'Quad D Register'.

#### FUNCTION TABLE

Image /page/2/Figure/3 description: The image shows a function table and an application diagram. The function table describes the behavior of a digital circuit based on its inputs, internal states, and outputs. The table lists functions such as "Output Three-State Control", "Wi Polarity", "Asynchronous Clear", and "Clock Enabled", along with their corresponding input conditions (CP, D, E, CLR, POL, OE-W, OE-Y), internal states (Q), and outputs (Wi, Y). The application diagram illustrates a circuit implementation using components like a chip labeled "Am25LS2519", LEDs, resistors, and connections to a data bus. The diagram shows how the chip's inputs (D0-D3, CP, E, CL, OE W, OE Y, POL) are connected to various components, and how its outputs (W0-W3, Y0-Y3) are used to drive the LEDs and connect to the data bus. The circuit is labeled as a "Convenient Register Content Monitor or Test Point".
