# Am25S07.Am25S08 Hex/Quad Parallel D Registers With Register Enable

## **Distinctive Characteristics**

- 4-bit and 6-bit high-speed parallel registers
- Common clock and common enable

## FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

The Am25S07 is a 6-bit, high-speed Schottky register with a buffered common register enable. The Am25S08 is a 4-bit register with a buffered common register enable. The devices are similiar to the Am54S/74S174 and Am54S/74S175 but feature the common register enable rather than common clear.

Both registers will find application in digital systems where information is associated with a logic gating signal. When the enable is LOW, data on the D inputs is stored in the Positive edge triggered D flip-flops

# Am25S08 LOADING RULES (In STTL Unit Loads)

# DEFINITION OF FUNCTIONAL TERMS

 $D_i$  The D flip-flop data inputs.

 $\mathbf{E}$  Enable. When the enable is LOW, data on the  $D_i$  inputs is transferred to the  $Q_i$  outputs on the LOW-to-HIGH clock transition. When the enable is HIGH, the  $\mathbf{Q}_i$  outputs do not change regardless of the data or clock input transitions.

CP Clock Pulse for the register. Enters data on the LOW-to-HIGH transition.

 $Q_i$  The TRUE register outputs.

 $\overline{\textbf{Q}}_{\textbf{i}}$  The complement register outputs

## SCHOTTKY INPUT/OUTPUT CURRENT INTERFACE CONDITIONS

Image /page/2/Figure/15 description: This image shows a circuit diagram with two sections labeled "DRIVING OUTPUT" and "DRIVEN INPUT." The "DRIVING OUTPUT" section includes a Vcc line at the top, connected to a series of transistors and resistors. A 50Ω NOM resistor is present, along with labels for IOH and IOL, indicating current flow. The "DRIVEN INPUT" section features a "UNIT LOAD" of 2.8 kΩ NOM, connected to a transistor and a Zener diode. Labels for IIL and IIH are also present, indicating current flow in this section. The diagram illustrates the interaction between the driving output and driven input stages in an electronic circuit.

Note: Actual current flow direction shown.

Image /page/3/Figure/0 description: The image shows a schematic diagram titled "APPLICATIONS" for a selective register loading of data on a synchronous clock. The diagram includes an "INPUT DATA BUS" connected to four "WORD" blocks labeled 1 through 4. Each word block contains components labeled "Am25S07" with inputs D0-D5 and outputs Q0-Q5, along with control inputs CP and E. A "SELECT" block with inputs A and B and outputs Y0, Y1, and Y2 is connected to the word blocks. An "ENABLE" input G is connected to an output Y3. The diagram also includes a "CLOCK" input connected to the CP inputs of the word blocks. Below the schematic is a "Pad Layout" diagram showing a chip layout with numbered pads from 1 to 16. The die size is indicated as 0.085" x 0.081".

## DEFINITION OF SWITCHING TERMS

(All switching times are measured at the 1.5V logic level unless otherwise noted.)

 $f_{\mbox{MAX}}$  The highest operating clock frequency.

- tp<sub>LH</sub> The propagation delay time from an input change to an output LOW-to-HIGH transition.
- tpHL The propagation delay time from an input change to an output HIGH-to-LOW transition.
- Pulse width. The time between the leading and trailing tpw edges of a pulse.
- Rise time. The time required for a signal to change from 10% tr to 90% of its measured values.
- $t_{\mathsf{f}}$ Fall time. The time required for a signal to change from 90% to 10% of its measured values.
- Set-up time. The time interval for which a signal must be ts applied and maintained at one input terminal before an active transition occurs at another input terminal.
- Hold time. The time interval for which a signal must be  $t_{h}$ retained at one input after an active transition occurs at another input terminal.
- Release time. The time interval for which a signal may tR be indeterminant at one input terminal before an active transition occurs at another input terminal. (The release time falls within the set-up time interval and is specified by some manufacturers as a negative hold time).

# SCHOTTKY PARAMETER MEASUREMENTS FOR STANDARD ACTIVE-PULLUP TOTEM-POLE OUTPUTS

SET-UP, HOLD, AND RELEASE TIMES

Image /page/4/Figure/15 description: The image shows a timing diagram with three signals: DATA INPUT, TIMING INPUT, and DATA INPUT. The DATA INPUT signal is a square wave that alternates between 0V and 3V. The TIMING INPUT signal is a pulse that rises from 0V to 3V. The DATA INPUT signal is a square wave that alternates between 0V and 3V. The diagram also shows the timing parameters ts, th, and tR.

Notes: 1. Diagram shown for HIGH data only. Output transition may be opposite sense. 2. Cross-hatched area is don't care condition.

Image /page/4/Figure/17 description: The image contains the words "PROPAGATION DELAY" in bold, black font.

Image /page/4/Figure/18 description: The image shows a timing diagram with two sets of waveforms. The first set illustrates the relationship between the input and output signals when the input transition is in the same phase as the output. The input signal transitions from 0V to 3V, and the output signal transitions from VOL to VOH after a delay of tPLH. Similarly, when the input signal transitions from 3V to 0V, the output signal transitions from VOH to VOL after a delay of tPHL. The second set of waveforms illustrates the relationship between the input and output signals when the input transition is in the opposite phase of the output. The input signal transitions from 3V to 0V, and the output signal transitions from VOL to VOH after a delay of tPLH. When the input signal transitions from 0V to 3V, the output signal transitions from VOH to VOL after a delay of tPHL. The diagram also includes voltage levels of 0V, 1.5V, and 3V for the input signals, and VOL, 1.5V, and VOH for the output signals.

## LOAD TEST CIRCUIT

Image /page/4/Figure/20 description: The image shows a circuit diagram with several components. On the left side, there's an input labeled "FROM OUTPUT UNDER TEST" connected to a node. This node is also connected to a "TEST POINT" above and a capacitor labeled "CL" below, which is grounded. A text note indicates that "CL INCLUDES PROBE AND JIG CAPACITANCE". To the right of the input node, a diode is connected in series with a resistor labeled "RL" and a voltage source labeled "VCC" at the top. Below the diode and resistor, there are three more diodes connected in series, all grounded. A text note indicates that "ALL DIODES" are "1N916 OR 1N3064".

## PULSE WIDTH

Image /page/4/Figure/22 description: The image shows two pulse diagrams. The top diagram is labeled "LOW-HIGH-LOW PULSE", and the bottom diagram is labeled "HIGH-LOW-HIGH PULSE". Both diagrams show a pulse that starts at a low level, rises to a high level, and then falls back to a low level. The diagrams also show a horizontal line at 1.5V. The width of the pulse is labeled "tpw".

Note: 1. Pulse Generator for All Pulses: Rate  $\leq$  1.0MHz; Z<sub>0</sub> = 50 $\Omega$ , t<sub>r</sub>  $\leq$  2.5 ns; t<sub>f</sub>  $\leq$  2.5 ns.

Image /page/5/Figure/0 description: This image shows the Schottky Input/Output Voltage Interface Conditions, Definition of Standard Terms, and Physical Dimensions of Dual-In-Line packages. The Schottky Input/Output Voltage Interface Conditions diagram shows the voltage levels for driving and driven devices, including minimum logic high output voltage, maximum logic low output voltage, noise immunity, and voltage levels for COM'L, MIL, and 3-State COM'L or MIL. The Definition of Standard Terms section defines terms such as HIGH, LOW, Input, Output, Negative Current, Positive Current, IIL, IIH, IOL, IOH, ISC, ICC, VIL, VIH, VOL, and VOH. The Physical Dimensions section provides diagrams and measurements for molded, ceramic, and flat packages, including dimensions for length, width, and height.
