# Am25S09

Quad Two-Input, High-Speed Register

## DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS

- Four-bit register accepts data from one of two 4-bit input fields.
- Edge-triggered clock action

- High-speed Schottky technology.
- Electrically tested and optically inspected dice for the assemblers of hybrid products.

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Am25S09 is a dual port high-speed, four-bit register using advanced Schottky technology to reduce the effect of transistor storage time. The register consists of four D flipflops with a buffered common clock, and a two-input multiplexer at the input of each flip-flop. A common select line, S. controls the four multiplexers. Data on the four

inputs selected by the S line is stored in the four flip-flops at the clock LOW-to-HIGH transition. When the S input is LOW, the  $D_{iA}$  input data will be stored in the register. When the S input is HIGH, the D<sub>iB</sub> input data will be stored in the register.

Image /page/0/Figure/11 description: The image shows a block diagram of a digital circuit. The diagram includes logic gates such as inverters, AND gates, and OR gates, as well as D flip-flops. The circuit has inputs labeled S, CP, D0A, D0B, D1A, D1B, D2A, D2B, D3A, and D3B, and outputs labeled Q0, Q1, Q2, and Q3. The diagram is labeled "BLOCK DIAGRAM" at the top, and the reference number "BD001500" is at the bottom right.

Image /page/5/Figure/5 description: This image shows a schematic diagram of a circuit with a driving output and a driven input. The driving output side includes transistors and resistors, with labels such as "VCC" and "50Ω NOM". The driven input side includes a transistor, a resistor labeled "UNIT LOAD 2.8kΩ NOM", and a Zener diode. Arrows indicate the direction of current flow, labeled as "I\_OH", "I\_OL", "I\_IL", and "I\_IH". The diagram is divided by a dashed vertical line, separating the driving output from the driven input. The text "IC000150" is at the bottom right corner.
