# DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS

- Shifts 4-bits of data to 0, 1, 2 or 3 places under control . of two select lines.
- 6.5ns typical data propagation delay
- Alternate source is 54S/74S350
- Three-state outputs for bus organized systems.

# GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Am25S10 is a combinatorial logic circuit that accepts a four-bit data word and shifts the word 0, 1, 2 or 3 places. The number of places to be shifted is determined by a twobit select field  $S_0$  and  $S_1$ . An active-LOW enable controls the three-state outputs. This feature allows expansion of shifting over a larger number of places with one delay.

By suitable interconnection, the Am25S10 can be used to shift any number of bits any number of places up or down. Shifting can be logical, with logic zeroes pulled in at either or both ends of the shifting field; arithmetic, where the sign bit is repeated during a shift down; or end around, where

the data word forms a continuous loop.

Image /page/0/Figure/11 description: The image shows a block diagram of a digital circuit. The diagram includes inputs labeled I3, I2, I1, I0, I1, I2, I3, S1, S0, and OE. These inputs are connected to a series of AND gates, which are then connected to OR gates. The outputs of the OR gates are labeled Y0, Y1, Y2, and Y3. The diagram also includes inverters connected to the S1, S0, and OE inputs. The diagram is labeled "BLOCK DIAGRAM" at the top and "BD002480" at the bottom.

A Schottky TTL Unit Load is defined as  $50\mu\text{A}$  at 2.7V at the HIGH and -2.0mA at 0.5V at the LOW.

Note 1. The fan-in on  $I_{-2}$ ,  $I_{-1}$ ,  $I_0$ ,  $I_1$  and  $I_2$  will not exceed 1.5 Unit Loads when measured at  $V_{IL} = 0.5V$ . As  $V_{IL}$  is decreased to a 0V, the input current  $I_{IL}$  MAX. increases to -4, -6, -8, -6 and -4mA respectively due to the decrease in current sharing with the internal select buffer outputs.

##### PERFORMANCE CURVES SWITCHING CHARACTERISTICS

Image /page/4/Figure/15 description: This figure shows the propagation delay in nanoseconds as a function of ambient temperature in degrees Celsius. The y-axis is labeled "tp - PROPAGATION DELAY - ns", and the x-axis is labeled "TA - AMBIENT TEMPERATURE - °C". There are two curves on the plot. The first curve is labeled "tPHL" and shows the propagation delay from high to low. The second curve is labeled "tPLH" and shows the propagation delay from low to high. The tPHL curve starts at approximately 8.4 ns at -75 degrees Celsius, decreases to approximately 8.1 ns at 50 degrees Celsius, and then increases to approximately 8.6 ns at 125 degrees Celsius. The tPLH curve starts at approximately 5.5 ns at -75 degrees Celsius, decreases to approximately 4.9 ns at 50 degrees Celsius, and then increases to approximately 5.1 ns at 125 degrees Celsius. The title of the figure is "Data to Output (Typical)". The number "OP001390" is in the lower right corner.

Image /page/4/Figure/16 description: The image contains the words "Select to Output (Typical)" in bold black font. The words are stacked on top of each other.

Image /page/4/Figure/17 description: The image is a graph showing the relationship between propagation delay and ambient temperature. The x-axis represents the ambient temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from -75 to 125. The y-axis represents the propagation delay in nanoseconds, ranging from 11.0 to 14.0. There are two curves on the graph, labeled 'tPHL' and 'tPLH'. The 'tPHL' curve starts at approximately 14.0 ns at -75 degrees Celsius, decreases to a minimum of approximately 13.1 ns around 50 degrees Celsius, and then slightly increases to approximately 13.3 ns at 125 degrees Celsius. The 'tPLH' curve starts at approximately 12.6 ns at -75 degrees Celsius, decreases to a minimum of approximately 11.3 ns around 50 degrees Celsius, and then slightly increases to approximately 11.5 ns at 125 degrees Celsius. The graph is labeled 'OP001400' in the bottom right corner.

# SCHOTTKY INPUT/OUTPUT CURRENT INTERFACE CONDITIONS

Image /page/5/Figure/2 description: This image shows a circuit diagram with a driving output on the left and a driven input on the right. The driving output side includes transistors and resistors connected to a voltage source labeled "Vcc" and ground. There is a "50Ω NOM" resistor connected to one of the transistors. The driven input side includes a "UNIT LOAD 2.8kΩ NOM" resistor and a transistor. Arrows labeled "IOL", "IOH", "IIL", and "IIH" indicate the direction of current flow. The text "IC000370" is at the bottom right of the image.

Note: Actual current flow direction shown.
