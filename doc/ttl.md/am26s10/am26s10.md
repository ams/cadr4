# **BUS TRANSCEIVERS**

Image /page/0/Figure/1 description: The image shows the connection diagrams and logic diagrams for the Am26S10, Am26S11, Am26S12, and Am26S12A bus transceivers. The Am26S10 and Am26S11 diagrams show the pinout of the chips, with the VCC, GND, and input/output pins labeled. The logic diagrams show the internal circuitry of the chips, with the AND gates, inverters, and transistors. The Am26S12 and Am26S12A diagrams show the pinout of the chips, with the VCC, GND, and input/output pins labeled. The logic diagrams show the internal circuitry of the chips, with the AND gates, inverters, and transistors.
