## FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

The Am27LS06 and Am27LS07 are 64-bit RAMs built using Schottky diode clamped transistors in conjunction with internal ECL circuitry and are ideal for use in scratch pad and high-speed buffer memory applications. Each memory is organized as a fully decoded 16-word memory of 4 bits per word. Easy memory expansion is provided by an active LOW chip select  $(\overline{\text{CS}})$  input and open collector OR tieable outputs (Am27LS06) or three-state outputs (Am27LS07). Chip selection for large memory systems can be controlled by active LOW output decoders such as the Am74LS189.

An active LOW Write line  $\overline{\text{WE}}$  controls the writing/reading operation of the memory. When the chip select and write lines are LOW the information on the four data inputs  $D_0$  to D<sub>3</sub> is written into the addressed memory word and preconditions the output circuitry so that correct data is present at the outputs when the write cycle is complete. This preconditioning operation insures minimum write recovery times by eliminating the "write recovery glitch".

Reading is performed with the chip select line LOW and the write line HIGH. The information stored in the addressed word is read out on the four noninverting outputs  $O_0$  to  $O_3$ .

During the writing operation or when the chip select line is HIGH the four outputs of the memory go to an inactive high impedance state.

For open collector Am27LS06, all delays from Write Enable ( $\overline{\text{W}}\overline{\text{E}}$ ) or Chip Select ( $\overline{\text{OS}}$ ) inputs to the Data Output (O<sub>0</sub>-O<sub>3</sub>), t<sub>PLZ</sub>( $\overline{\text{W}}\overline{\text{E}}$ ), t<sub>PLZ</sub>( $\overline{\text{WS}}$ ), t<sub>PLZ</sub>( $\overline{\text{MS}}$ )  $t_{\text{PZL}}(\overline{\text{WE}})$  and  $t_{\text{PZL}}(\overline{\text{CS}})$  are measured with S<sub>1</sub> closed and C<sub>L</sub> = 30pF and with both the input and output timing referenced to 1.5V.

Image /page/3/Figure/7 description: The image shows switching waveforms for a write mode operation, with \overline{CS} (Chip Select) being low unless otherwise noted. The diagram includes waveforms for ADDRESS (A0-3), \overline{WE} (Write Enable), D0-3 (Data Input), and 00-3 (Output). The waveforms illustrate the timing relationships between these signals during a write cycle. Key timing parameters such as ts(A), th(A), tpw(\overline{WE}), ts(DI), th(DI), tpLZ(\overline{WE}), tpZH(\overline{WE}), tpZL(\overline{WE}), and tpHZ(\overline{WE}) are indicated on the diagram. A key to the timing diagram explains the different waveform styles, indicating whether signals must be steady, may change from high to low, may change from low to high, or are in a 'don't care' state. The diagram also includes a note stating that the write cycle is initiated by an address change, and after ts(A) min, the write enable may begin, with the chip select also needing to be LOW for writing. Following the write pulse, th(A) min must be allowed before the next cycle.

The chip select must also be LOW for writing. Following the write pulse,  $t_h(A)$  min must be allowed before the address may be changed again. The output will be inactive (floating for the Am27LS07) while the write enable is LOW or the chip select is HIGH.
