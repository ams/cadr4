## FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION

The Am73/8303 and Am73/8304B are 8-bit 3-State Schottky transceivers. They provide bidirectional drive for bus-oriented microprocessor and digital communications systems. Straight through bidirectional transceivers are featured, with 16mA drive capability on the A ports and 48mA bus drive capability on the B ports. PNP inputs are incorporated to reduce input loading.

One input, Transmit/Receive determines the direction of logic signals through the bidirectional transceiver. The Chip Disable input disables both A and B ports by placing them in a 3-state condition. Chip Disable is functionally the same as an active LOW chip select.

The output high voltage ( $V_{\text{OH}}$ ) is specified at  $V_{\text{CC}}$  -1.15V minimum to allow interfacing with MOS, CMOS, TTL, ROM, RAM, or microprocessors.

 $\text{GND} = \text{Pin 10}$ 

Image /page/0/Figure/19 description: The image shows the logic diagram, connection diagram, and logic symbol for the Am73/8303 and Am73/8304B integrated circuits. The logic diagram shows the internal logic gates and connections between the A and B ports. The connection diagram shows the pinout of the IC, with the pin numbers and corresponding signals labeled. The logic symbol shows a simplified representation of the IC, with the A and B ports and control signals labeled.

Note: Pin 1 is marked for orientation.

### DEFINITION OF FUNCTIONAL TERMS

- $A_0$ - $A_7$  A port inputs/outputs are receiver output drivers when  $T/\overline{R}$ is LOW and are transmit inputs when  $T/\overline{R}$  is HIGH.
- $\textbf{B_0-B_7} \;$  B port inputs/outputs are transmit output drivers when T/R is HIGH and receiver inputs when  $\overline{T/R}$  is LOW.
- CD Chip Disable forces all output drivers into 3-state when HIGH (same function as active LOW chip select, CS).

T/R Transmit/Receive direction control determines whether A port or B port drivers are in 3-state. With  $T/\overline{R}$  HIGH A port is the input and B port is the output. With  $T/\overline{R}$  LOW A port is the output and B port is the input.

Image /page/4/Figure/1 description: The image shows three figures related to switching time waveforms and AC test circuits. Figure 1 illustrates the propagation delay from A Port to B Port or from B Port to A Port, including waveforms for input and output signals, along with a circuit diagram involving a pulse generator, device under test, resistors, and a capacitor. Figure 2 depicts the propagation delay from T/R to A Port or B Port, presenting waveforms for input and output signals, and a circuit diagram with a pulse generator, device under test, resistors, and capacitors. Figure 3 illustrates the propagation delay from CD to A Port or B Port, including waveforms for input and output signals, and a circuit diagram with a pulse generator, device under test, resistors, and a capacitor. Each figure includes notes about test fixture capacitance and specific conditions.

## Am73/8303/8304B

Image /page/5/Figure/1 description: The image shows the metallization and pad layouts for Am73/8303 and Am73/8304B chips, along with ordering information. The layouts depict the arrangement of pins and internal circuitry for each chip, with labeled connections such as VCC, A0-A7, B0-B7, CD, GND, and T/R. The ordering information is presented in a table format, listing order numbers for both Am73/8303 and Am73/8304B, package types (D-20, P-20, Dice), operating conditions (C, M), and screening levels (C-3, B-3, C-1, B-1, Visual inspection to MIL-STD-883 Method 2010B). Notes provide additional details on package types, operating temperature and voltage ranges, and screening level conformance to MIL-STD-883 standards.
