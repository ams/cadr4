■ Three-State Output

The Intel 2147H is a 4096-bit static Random Access Memory organized as 4096 words by 1-bit using HMOS III, an ultra high-performance MOS technology. It uses a uniquely innovative design approach which provides the ease-of-use features associated with non-clocked static memories and the reduced standby power dissipation associated with clocked static memories. To the user this means low standby power dissipation without the need for clocks, address setup and hold times, nor reduced data rates due to cycle times that are longer than access times.

 $\overline{\text{CS}}$  controls the power-down feature. In less than a cycle time after  $\overline{\text{CS}}$  goes high—deselecting the 2147H the part automatically reduces its power requirements and remains in this low power standby mode as long as CS remains high. This device feature results in system power savings as great as 85% in larger systems, where the majority of devices are deselected.

The 2147H is assembled in an 18-pin package configured with the industry standard 2147 pinout. It is directly TTL compatible in all respects: inputs, output, and a single  $+5V$  supply. The data is read out nondestructively and has the same polarity as the input data. A data input and a separate three-state output are used.

Image /page/0/Figure/18 description: The image shows a diagram of a memory chip, including its pin configuration, logic symbol, block diagram, pin names, and truth table. The pin configuration shows the arrangement of the chip's pins, labeled A0-A11, VCC, GND, WE, CS, DIN, and DOUT. The logic symbol provides a simplified representation of the chip's functionality. The block diagram illustrates the internal structure of the chip, including the memory array, row select, column I/O circuits, and column select. The pin names table defines the function of each pin. The truth table summarizes the chip's behavior based on the inputs CS and WE, showing the mode, output, and power consumption for each combination of inputs.

HMOS is a patent process of Intel.

## **Read Cycle**

#### 2147H

## WAVEFORMS

Image /page/3/Figure/2 description: This image shows a timing diagram for a read cycle. The diagram has two signals, ADDRESS and DATA OUT. The ADDRESS signal transitions from low to high and then back to low. The DATA OUT signal is valid before the ADDRESS signal transitions, then becomes invalid, and then becomes valid again. The diagram also shows the timing parameters tAC, tAA, and tOH.

### Read Cycle No. 2(4, 6)

Image /page/3/Figure/4 description: This image shows a timing diagram for a read cycle. The diagram includes three signals: C3, DATA OUT, and VCC SUPPLY CURRENT. The C3 signal is a digital signal that goes low to initiate the read cycle. The DATA OUT signal is initially in a high impedance state, then becomes valid after a delay of tLZ and tACS. The DATA OUT signal remains valid for the duration of the read cycle, then returns to a high impedance state after a delay of tHZ. The VCC SUPPLY CURRENT signal is initially at a low level, then rises to a high level after a delay of tPU. The VCC SUPPLY CURRENT signal remains at a high level for the duration of the read cycle, then returns to a low level after a delay of tPO. The diagram also includes labels for the various timing parameters, such as tAC, tLZ, tACS, tHZ, tPU, and tPO.

#### NOTES:

1. All Read Cycle timings are referenced from the last valid address to the first transitioning address.

2. At any given temperature and voltage condition, t<sub>HZ</sub> max. is less than t<sub>LZ</sub> min. both for a given device and from device to device.

3. Transition is measured  $\pm 500$  mV from steady state voltage with specified loading in Figure 2.

4. WE is high for Read Cycles.

5. Device is continuously selected. CS = V

5. Device is continuously selected,  $\overline{CS} = V_{IL}$ .<br>6. Addresses valid prior to or coincident with  $\overline{CS}$  transition low.

7. This parameter is sampled and not 100% tested.

8. Chip deselected for greater than 55 ns prior to selection.

9. Chip deselected for a finite time that is less than 55 ns prior to selection. If the deselect time is 0 ns, the chip is by definition selected and access occurs according to Read Cycle No. 1. Applies to 2147H, 2147H-3.
