# DM7838/DM8838 quad unified bus transceiver

#### general description

The DM7838/DM8838 are quad high speed drivers? receivers designed for use in bus organized data that transmission systems interconnected by terminated  $120\Omega$  impedance lines. The external termination is intended to be a  $180\Omega$  resistor from the bus to the +5V logic supply together with a  $390\Omega$ resistor from the bus to ground. The bus can be terminated at one or both ends. Low bus pin current allows up to 27 driver/receiver pairs to utilize a common bus. The bus loading is unchanged when  $V_{\text{CC}} = 0V$ . The receivers incorporate hysteresis to greatly enhance bus noise immunity. One two-input NOR gate is included to disable all drivers in a package simultaneously. Receiver performance is optimized for systems with bus rise and fall times  $< 10\mu s$ .

##### nime of features D of the C

##### $\frac{1}{2}$ $\mathbf{2}$ totally separate driver/receiver pairs per package

- 1V typical receiver input hysteresis
- Receiver hysteresis independent of receiver output load
- Guaranteed minimum bus noise immunity of 1.3V, 2V typ.
- Temperature-insensitive receiver thresholds track bus logic levels
- $20\mu A$  typical bus terminal current with normal  $V_{cc}$  or with  $V_{cc} = 0V$
- Open collector driver output allows wire-OR connection
- High speed
- Series 74 TTL compatible driver and disable inputs and receiver outputs

Image /page/0/Figure/16 description: The image shows a typical application and connection diagram for a DM7838 integrated circuit. The typical application diagram shows four DM7838 chips connected to a 120-ohm unified data bus. The connection diagram shows the pinout of the DM7838 in a dual in-line and flat package. The pinout is labeled with the following signals: VCC, BUS1, IN1, OUT1, BUS2, IN2, OUT2, DISABLE A, BUS3, IN3, OUT3, BUS4, IN4, OUT4, DISABLE B, and GND. The order numbers for the DM7838 are DM7838J, DM8838J, DM7838W, DM8838W, and DM8838N. The package numbers are 17, 28, and 23.
