# DM9328 **Dual 8-Bit Shift Register**

### **General Description**

The DM9328 is a high speed serial storage element providing 16 bits of storage in the form of two 8-bit registers. The multifunctional capability of this device is provided by several features: 1) additional gating is provided at the input to both shift registers so that the input is easily multiplexed between two sources; 2) the clock of each register may be provided separately or together; 3) both the true and complementary outputs are provided from each 8-bit register, and both registers may be master cleared from a common input.

Image /page/0/Figure/8 description: The image shows a logic symbol and connection diagram for a digital circuit, along with pin descriptions. The logic symbol consists of two OR gates, each with inputs labeled S, D0, D1, CP, and MR, and outputs labeled Q7 and Q7 (with a bar over it). The connection diagram shows a 16-pin integrated circuit (IC) package with pins labeled MR, Q7, Q7, S, D1, D0, CP, GND, COM, CP, D0, D1, S, Q7, Q7, and VCC. The pin descriptions table lists the pin names S, D0, D1, CP, MR, Q7, and Q7 (with a bar over it), along with their corresponding descriptions: Data Select Input, Data Inputs, Clock Pulse Input (Active HIGH), Master Reset Input (Active LOW), Last Stage Output, and Complementary Output. Additional notes indicate that VCC is pin 16 and GND is pin 8, and that CP is common at pin 9 and separate at pins 7 and 10.

#### **Functional Description**

The two 8-bit shift registers have a common clock input (pin 9) and separate clock inputs (pins 10 and 7). The clocking of each register is controlled by the OR function of the separate and the common clock input. Each register is composed of eight clocked RS master/slave flip-flops and a number of gates. The clock OR gate drives the eight clock inputs of the flip-flops in parallel. When the two clock inputs (the separate and the common) to the OR gate are LOW. the slave latches are steady, but data can enter the master latches via the R and S input. During the first LOW-to-HIGH transition of either, or both simultaneously, of the two clock inputs, the data inputs (R and S) are inhibited so that a later change in input data will not affect the master; then the now trapped information in the master is transferred to the slave. When the transfer is complete, both the master and the slave are steady as long as either or both clock inputs remain HIGH. During the HIGH-to-LOW transition of the last remaining HIGH clock input, the transfer path from master to slave is inhibited first, leaving the slave steady in its present state. The data inputs (R and S) are enabled so that new data can enter the master. Either of the clock inputs can be used as clock inhibit inputs by applying a logic HIGH signal. Each 8-bit shift register has a 2-input

multiplexer in front of the serial data input. The two data inputs D0 and D1 are controlled by the data select input  $(S)$ following the Boolean expression:

Serial data in:  $S_D = SD0 + SD1$ 

An asynchronous master reset is provided which, when activated by a LOW logic level, will clear all 16 stages independently of any other input signal.

Image /page/1/Figure/11 description: The image is a logic diagram. At the top left are logic gates with inputs labeled D1, D0, and S. These gates feed into an inverter, which then connects to a series of flip-flops labeled Q0 through Q7. Each flip-flop has inputs S, CP, and R, and outputs CD. The bottom half of the diagram mirrors the top half, with similar logic gates and flip-flops, but with an additional input labeled MR.

## Absolute Maximum Ratings(Note 1)

| Supply Voltage                       | 7V                                  |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Input Voltage                        | 5.5V                                |
| Operating Free Air Temperature Range | $0^{\circ}$ C to $+70^{\circ}$ C    |
| Storage Temperature Range            | $-65^{\circ}$ C to $+150^{\circ}$ C |

 $\textbf{Note 1:}$  The "Absolute Maximum Ratings" are those values beyond which the safety of the device cannot be guaranteed. The device should not be operated at these limits. The parametric values defined in the "Electrical Characteristics" table are not guaranteed at the absolute maximum ratings. The "Recommended Operating Conditions" table will define the conditions for actual device operation.
