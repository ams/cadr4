## National<br>Semiconductor

#### DM93425. DM93425A TTL 1024 × 1-bit fully decoded random access memories

#### general description

The DM93425 and DM93425A are 1024-bit read/write Random Access Memories organized 1024 words by 1-bit. They are designed for buffer control storage and high performance main memory applications. The devices have typical address access times of 40 ns for the DM93425 and 30 ns for the DM93425A.

The DM93425 and DM93425A include full decoding on-chip, separate data input and data output lines and an active low chip select and write enable. They are fully compatible with standard DTL and TTL logic. families. A TRI-STATE<sup>®</sup> output is provided to drive bus organized systems and/or highly capacitive loads.

Image /page/0/Figure/16 description: The image shows a circuit diagram for a memory chip. The diagram includes blocks labeled "WORD DRIVER", "32 X 32 ARRAY", "SENSE AMPS AND WRITE DRIVERS", and "ADDRESS DECODER". There are two address decoders, one with inputs labeled A0 through A4 and the other with inputs labeled A5 through A9. The diagram also includes logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT gates, which are connected to the various blocks. The output of the circuit is labeled "DOUT" and is connected to pin 7. Other pins labeled are CS (pin 1), WE (pin 14), and DIN (pin 15). The diagram also indicates that VCC is connected to pin 16 and GND is connected to pin 8.
