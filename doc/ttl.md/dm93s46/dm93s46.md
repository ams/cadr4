Image /page/0/Figure/0 description: The image shows the datasheet for the 93S46 high-speed 6-bit identity comparator. The datasheet includes a description of the device, its features, ordering code, pin names, and a logic symbol. The description states that the device compares two words of up to six bits and indicates identity in less than 12 ns. The features include that it compares two 6-bit words in 12 ns, is easily expandable to any word size, and has an active high enable for fast ripple expansion. The ordering code section lists the commercial and military grades for different package types, including plastic DIP, ceramic DIP, and flatpak. The pin names section lists the names of the pins on the device, including A0-A5, B0-B5, E, and A=B. The logic symbol shows the arrangement of the pins on the device.

**FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION** — The '46 is a very high speed 6-bit identity comparator. The  $A = B$  output is HIGH when the Enable (E) is HIGH and the two 6-bit words are equal. Equality is determined by Exclusive-NOR circuits which individually compare the equivalent bits from each word. When any two of the equivalent bits from each word have different logic levels, the  $A = B$  output is LOW.

$$(A = B) = (\overline{A_0 \oplus B_0}) \bullet (\overline{A_1 \oplus B_1}) \bullet (\overline{A_2 \oplus B_2}) \bullet (\overline{A_3 \oplus B_3}) \bullet (\overline{A_4 \oplus B_4}) \bullet (\overline{A_5 \oplus B_5}) \bullet E$$

An active HIGH Enable (E) provides a means of fast ripple expansion. By connecting the  $A = B$  output of the first stage of the comparator to the enable of the next stage, the comparator can be expanded in 6-bit increments at an additional 4.5 ns per stage. An even faster expansion technique is achieved by connecting the  $A = B$  outputs to a Schottky NAND gate. This method compares two words of up to 78 bits each in 15 ns (typical) using the '133 13-input Schottky NAND gate.

| H      | $A_n \neq B_n$ | L      |

Image /page/1/Figure/5 description: This image shows two different methods of expansion for a digital circuit, labeled as "RIPPLE EXPANSION" and "PARALLEL EXPANSION". Both methods use multiple instances of a component labeled "93S46" with inputs A0 to A5 and B0 to B5, as well as an enable input E. In the ripple expansion, the output of one 93S46 component is connected to the enable input E of the next component in a chain. The final output is (A=B)\*E. In the parallel expansion, the enable inputs E of all 93S46 components are connected together. The outputs of the 93S46 components are fed into a SCHOTTKY NAND GATE, and the final output is (A=B)\*E. Notes below each expansion method describe the time delay added by each method.

Image /page/2/Figure/0 description: The image shows a logic diagram and DC/AC characteristics of an electronic component. The logic diagram consists of six NOR gates with inputs labeled A0 B0, A1 B1, A2 B2, A3 B3, A4 B4, and A5 B5. The outputs of these gates are connected to a NAND gate, which is then connected to an AND gate. The output of the AND gate is labeled A = B. There is also an inverter gate with input E. The DC characteristics table shows the power supply current (Icc) with a maximum value of 70 mA under the condition Vcc = Max. The AC characteristics section specifies that Vcc = +5.0 V and TA = +25°C. It also mentions a parameter with a value of CL = 15 pF.
