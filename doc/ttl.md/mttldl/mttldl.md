# Multiple TTL Military Logic Delay Line

The Multiple TTL Military Logic Delay Lines manufactured by Engineered Components Company are designed to provide an output waveform that reproduces the input waveform after a set amount of delay time has elapsed. These delay lines are non-inverting. The delay times are calibrated to the listed tolerances on the rising edge delays. Each module consists of 3 separate delay lines, each isolated and individually buffered.

The MTBF on these modules, when calculated per MIL-HDBK-217, for a 50 deg.C ground fixed environment and with 50VDC applied, is in excess of 1.5 million hours. The temperature coefficient of delay is less than 1200 ppm/deq.C over a temperature range of  $-55$  to  $+100$  deq. C. These modules are designed to operate over the full military temperature range of  $-55$  to  $+125$  deg. C.

The module is provided in a 14-pin DIP package, fully encapsulated in epoxy resin and is housed in a Diallyl Phthalate case, red in color. The case marking is applied by silkscreen using white epoxy paint. The 8 copper leads are tin-lead plated and meet the solderability requirements of MIL-STD-202, Method 208.

Image /page/0/Figure/4 description: The image shows a block diagram of a circuit. The circuit has three inputs labeled IN1, IN2, and IN3, and three outputs labeled OUT1, OUT2, and OUT3. Each input is connected to an input buffer, which is connected to a delay line, which is connected to an output buffer, which is connected to the corresponding output. There are also two additional terminals labeled V and C. The terminals are numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14.
