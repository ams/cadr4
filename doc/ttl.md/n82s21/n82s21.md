#### DESCRIPTION

The 82S21 is a TTL 64 bit Write-While-Read Random Access Memory organized in 32 words of 2 bits each. The 82S21 is ideally suited for high speed buffers and as the memory element in high speed accumulators.

Words are selected through a 5 input decoder when the Read-Write enable input, CE is at logic "1".  $\overline{\text{W}_0}$  and  $\overline{\text{W}_1}$  are the write inputs for bit 0 and bit 1 of the word selected.  $\overline{\text{C}}$  is the write control input. When  $\overline{\text{W}_{X}}$  and  $\overline{\text{C}}$  are both at logic "0" data on the  $I_{0}$  and  $I_{1}$  data lines are written into the addressed word. The read function is enabled when either  $\overline{\text{W}_X}$  or  $\overline{\text{C}}$  is at logic "1".An internal latch is on the chip to provide the Write-While-Read capability. When the latch control line,  $\overline{L}$ , is logic "1" and data is being read from the 82S21, the latch is effectively bypassed. The data at the output will be that of the addressed word. When  $\overline{\mathsf{L}}$  goes from a logic "1" to logic "0" the outputs are latched and will remain latched regardless of the state of any other address or control line. When  $\overline{\text{L}}$  goes from "0" to "1" the outputs unlatch and the outputs will be that of the present address word.

- 4. process changes and improvements. 5.

(+) means positive going transition of the voltage signal. (-) means negative going transition of the voltage signal.

#### AC WAVEFORMS

Image /page/1/Figure/12 description: The image shows two timing diagrams. The first diagram, labeled "Fig. 1 Read Access Time", shows the timing relationship between the address input (Ai) and the output (Oi). The address input transitions, and after a delay of t1, the output transitions. The second diagram, labeled "Fig. 2 Address Setup and Hold Time", shows the timing relationship between the address input (Ai) and the control signal (C or W). The address input transitions, and after a delay of t2, the control signal transitions. The control signal remains active for a period of t5, and then transitions back. After a delay of t4, the address input transitions back.

#### TYPICAL APPLICATION

Image /page/2/Figure/4 description: This image shows a schematic diagram of a basic 8-bit fully buffered accumulator. The diagram includes several components, such as 82S33, 82S21, and 74181. The 82S33 components are connected to inputs labeled D0E0, D1E1, D2E2, D3E3, D4E4, D5E5, D6E6, and D7E7, as well as control lines S0 and S1. The 82S21 components are arranged in a dashed box labeled "A" REGISTER. There are also 82S21 components connected to data inputs labeled D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, and D7, which are described as DATA INPUT TO "B" REGISTER. The 74181 components are connected to inputs labeled B0A0, S1A1, B2A2, B3A3, B4A4, B5A5, B6A6, and B7A7, as well as outputs labeled C0 and CIN. The 74181 components are also connected to inputs labeled E0, E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, and E7. The diagram is accompanied by text that explains how the control lines S0 and S1 are used to load data into the "A" register through inputs Dx or from the outputs of the 74181's (Ex) to the 82S33's and stored in the 82S21's organized as a 32 x 8 RAM register. The text also mentions that data is loaded directly into the "B" register.

the 82S33's and stored in the 82S21's organized as a 32  $\times$  8 RAM register. Data is loaded directly into the "B" register. With this arrangement, the function A+B - A (A plus B into A) can be performed in 70ns, typically, starting from data stored in the 82S21's.
