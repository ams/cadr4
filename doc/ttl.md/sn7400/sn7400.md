#### **9.2.1 Design Requirements**

These devices use BJT technology and have unbalanced output drive with I<sub>OL</sub> and I<sub>OH</sub> specified as per the Recommended Operating Conditions.

#### 9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

- Recommended Input Conditions:
  - The inputs are TTL compliant.
  - Because the base-emitter junction at the inputs breaks down, no voltage greater than 5.5 V must be applied to the inputs.
  - Specified high and low levels: See  $V_{IH}$  and  $V_{IL}$  in *Recommended Operating Conditions*. \_
- Recommended Output Conditions:
  - No more than one output must be shorted at a time as per the *Electrical Characteristics: SNx400* for thermal stability and reliability.
  - For high-current applications, consider thermal characteristics of the package listed in *Thermal* Information.

### 10 Power Supply Recommendations

The power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating located in *Recommended Operating Conditions* for each of the SNx4LS00, SNx4S00, and SNx400 devices.

Each  $V_{CC}$  pin must have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For devices with a single supply, 0.1  $\mu$ F is recommended; if there are multiple V<sub>CC</sub> pins, then 0.01  $\mu$ F or 0.022  $\mu$ F is recommended for each power pin. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass capacitors to reject different frequencies of noise. A 0.1 µF and a 1  $\mu$ F are commonly used in parallel. The bypass capacitor must be installed as close to the power pin as possible for best results.

## 11 Layout

### 11.1 Layout Guidelines

When using multiple bit logic, devices inputs must never float.

Devices with multiple-emitter inputs (SN74 and SN74S series) need special care. Because no voltage greater than 5.5 V must be applied to the inputs (if exceeded, the base-emitter junction at the inputs breaks down), the inputs of these devices must be connected to the supply voltage,  $V_{\text{CC}}$ , through series resistor,  $R_{\text{S}}$  (see Figure 5). This resistor must be dimensioned such that the current flowing into the gate or gates, which results from overvoltage, does not exceed 1 mA. However, because the high-level input current of the circuits connected to the gate flows through this resistor, the resistor must be dimensioned so that the voltage drop across it still allows the required high level. Equation 1 and Equation 2 are for dimensioning resistor,  $R_S$ , and several inputs can be connected to a high level through a single resistor if the following conditions are met.

$$R_{S(min)} = \frac{V_{CCP} \space 5.5 \space V}{1 \space mA}$$
(1)  
$$R_{S(max)} = \frac{V_{CC(min)} \space 2.4 \space V}{n \space I_{IH}}$$

where

- n = number of inputs connected
- $I_{IH}$  = high input current (typical 40  $\mu$ A)
- $V_{CC(min)} = \text{minimum supply voltage}, V_{CC}$
- $V_{CCP}$  = maximum peak voltage of the supply voltage,  $V_{CC}$  (about 7 V)

### 11.2 Layout Example
