Image /page/7/Figure/2 description: This image shows parameter measurement information for the series 54/74 and 54S/74S devices. It includes three load circuit diagrams: one for 2-state totem-pole outputs, one for open-collector outputs, and one for 3-state outputs. The diagrams show the connections of VCC, RL, CL, and the test point. There are also voltage waveform diagrams for pulse durations, setup and hold times, propagation delay times, and enable and disable times for 3-state outputs. The pulse duration diagram shows high-level and low-level pulses with a voltage of 1.5 V. The setup and hold times diagram shows timing and data inputs with a voltage of 3 V. The propagation delay times diagram shows input, in-phase output, and out-of-phase output with voltages of 3 V, VOH, and VOL. The enable and disable times diagram shows output control, waveform 1, and waveform 2 with voltages of 3 V, ≈1.5 V, VOL + 0.5 V, VOH - 0.5 V, and ≈1.5 V.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures. "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

STRUMENTS

Image /page/13/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The reel is shown from the front and the side. The reel diameter is labeled with an arrow pointing to the diameter of the reel. The reel width (W1) is labeled with an arrow pointing to the width of the reel.

Image /page/13/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions for a component carrier tape. The diagram includes labels for various dimensions such as A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers. The diagram also shows the location of the cavity within the tape.

#### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/13/Figure/7 description: The image shows a section of a carrier tape with sprocket holes along the top edge. There are three pockets visible, each divided into four quadrants labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed, and a label points to the pocket quadrants.

CERAMIC DUAL IN LINE PACKAGE

Image /page/21/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a ceramic dual in-line package. The pattern consists of 14 pads on each side, with the first and last pads being square and the rest being circular. The pads are arranged in two parallel rows, with a symmetrical layout. The image includes two detailed views, labeled "DETAIL A" and "DETAIL B", showing the dimensions and construction of the pads. Detail A shows a square pad with a solder mask opening, while Detail B shows a circular pad with a solder mask opening. The image also includes dimensions for the pads and spacing between them. The scale of the land pattern example is 5X, while the scales of Detail A and Detail B are 15X.
