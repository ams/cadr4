### description

These devices contain two independent J-K positiveedge-triggered flip-flops. A low level at the preset or clear inputs sets or resets the outputs regardless of the levels of the other inputs. When preset and clear are inactive (high), data at the J and  $\overline{\text{K}}$  inputs meeting the setup time requirements are transferred to the outputs on the positive-going edge of the clock pulse. Clock triggering occurs at a voltage level and is not directly related to the rise time of the clock pulse. Following the hold time interval, data at the J and  $\overline{\text{K}}$  inputs may be changed without affecting the levels at the outputs. These versatile flip-flops can perform as toggle flip-flops by grounding  $\overline{K}$  and tying J high. They also can perform as D-type flip-flops if J and  $\overline{\mathsf{K}}$  are tied together.

The SN54109 and SN54LS109A are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55°C to 125°C. The SN74109 and SN74LS109A are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

 $^{\dagger}$  The output levels in this configuration are not guaranteed to meet the minimum levels for  $\mathbf{V}_{\mbox{OH}}$  if the lows at preset and clear are near  $V_{1L}$  maximum. Furthermore, this configuration is nonstable; that is, it will not persist when preset or clear return to their inactive (high) level.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows: **ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

RoHS Exempt: TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

**ISTRUMENTS** 

Image /page/8/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The reel is shown from the front and the side. The reel diameter is labeled with an arrow pointing to the diameter of the reel. The reel width (W1) is labeled with an arrow pointing to the width of the reel.

Image /page/8/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions with labels and a table explaining the labels. The diagram shows a section of tape with cavities and dimensions labeled as A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers.

### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE
