### description

١

These devices contain two independent J-K negative-edge-triggered flip-flops. A low level at the preset and clear inputs sets or resets the outputs regardless of the levels of the other inputs. When preset and clear are inactive (high), data at the J and K inputs meeting the setup time requirements are transferred to the outputs on the negative-going edge of the clock pulse. Clock triggering occurs at a voltage level and is not directly related to the rise time of the clock pulse. Following the hold time interval, data at the J and K inputs may be changed without affecting the levels at the outputs. These versatile flip-flops can perform as toggle flip-flops by tying J and K high.

The SN54LS112A and SN54S112 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of  $-55$ °C to 125°C. The SN74LS112A and SN74S112A are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

<sup>†</sup> The output levels in this configuration are not guaranteed to meet the minimum levels for  $V_{\rm OH}$  if the lows at preset and clear are near  $V_{\text{IL}}$  minimum. Furthermore, this configuration is nonstable; that is, it will not persist when either preset or clear returns to its inactive (high) level.

<sup>5</sup>Not more than one output should be shorted at a time, and the duration of the short-circuit should not exceed one second.

NOTES: 2. For certain devices where state commutation can be caused by shorting an output to ground, an equivalent test may be performed with  $V_{\rm O}$  = 2.25 V and 2.125 V for the '54 family and the '74 family, respectively, with the minimum and maximum limits reduced to one half of their stated values.

3. With all outputs open, ICC is measured with the Q and Q outputs high in turn. At the time of measurement, the clock input is grounded.

(3) **RoHS values:** Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.

(4) Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the column width.

(5) MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is sho Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.

(6) **Part marking:** There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the t combined represent the entire part marking for that device.

### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

ISTRUMENTS

Image /page/10/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The top of the diagram shows a side view of the reel, with the "Reel Diameter" labeled with an arrow pointing to the diameter of the reel. The bottom of the diagram shows a side view of the reel, with the "Reel Width (W1)" labeled with an arrow pointing to the width of the reel. The title of the diagram is "REEL DIMENSIONS".

Image /page/10/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions with labels for various measurements. The diagram includes labels for A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is described as the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers.

### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/10/Figure/7 description: The image shows a section of a carrier tape with multiple pockets, each divided into four quadrants labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. The tape has sprocket holes along the top edge. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed.

SOP

Image /page/20/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a SOP (Small Outline Package) component, along with solder mask details. The land pattern consists of two rows of rectangular pads, each with 16 pads. The pads are labeled with dimensions such as 16X (1.85), 16X (0.6), and 14X (1.27). The distance between the two rows of pads is labeled as (7). The land pattern example is scaled at 7X. The solder mask details show two scenarios: non-solder mask defined and solder mask defined. In the non-solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening extends 0.07 MAX all around the metal pad. In the solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening is smaller, with a 0.07 MIN distance all around the metal pad. The image also includes labels such as METAL, SOLDER MASK OPENING, and SYMM (symmetry).

NOTES: (continued)

5. Publication IPC-7351 may have alternate designs.

6. Solder mask tolerances between and around signal pads can vary based on board fabrication site.

SOP

Image /page/21/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a solder paste example for a surface mount component, likely a small outline package (SOP). The diagram includes dimensions and annotations. There are two rows of rectangular pads, each containing 8 pads. The pads are arranged symmetrically about a central vertical axis. The diagram includes dimensions such as 16X (1.85), 16X (0.6), 14X (1.27), and (R0.05) TYP, indicating the size and spacing of the pads. The numbers 1, 8, 9, and 16 are placed near the pads to indicate pin numbers. The text "SOLDER PASTE EXAMPLE BASED ON 0.125 mm THICK STENCIL SCALE:7X" indicates that the diagram is an example of a solder paste stencil design. The diagram also includes symmetry symbols (SYMM) and a dimension of (7) between the two rows of pads. The bottom right corner has the text "4220735/A 12/2021".

NOTES: (continued)

7. Laser cutting apertures with trapezoidal walls and rounded corners may offer better paste release. IPC-7525 may have alternate design recommendations.

8. Board assembly site may have different recommendations for stencil design.
