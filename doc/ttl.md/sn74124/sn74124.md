#### description

The 'S124 features two independent voltagecontrolled oscilllators (VCO) in a single monolithic chip. The output frequency of each VCO is established by an external capacitor in combination with two voltage-sensitive inputs, one for frequency range and one for frequency control. These inputs can be used to vary the output frequency as shown under typical characteristics. These highly stable oscillators can be set to operate at any frequency typically between 0.12 hertz and 85 megahertz.

Image /page/0/Figure/10 description: The image shows two diagrams of integrated circuit pinouts. The first diagram is labeled "SN54S124... J OR W PACKAGE SN74S124... D OR N PACKAGE (TOP VIEW)". It depicts a rectangular chip with 16 pins. Pin 1 is labeled "2FC", pin 2 is labeled "1FC", pin 3 is labeled "1 RNG", pin 4 is labeled "1 CX1", pin 5 is labeled "1 CX2", pin 6 is labeled "1 EN", pin 7 is labeled "1Y", pin 8 is labeled "OSC GND", pin 9 is labeled "GND", pin 10 is labeled "2Y", pin 11 is labeled "2 EN", pin 12 is labeled "2 CX1", pin 13 is labeled "2 CX2", pin 14 is labeled "2 RNG", pin 15 is labeled "OSC VCC", and pin 16 is labeled "VCC". The second diagram is labeled "SN54S124... FK PACKAGE (TOP VIEW)". It depicts an octagonal chip with 20 pins. Pin 1 is labeled "NC", pin 2 is labeled "2FC", pin 3 is labeled "1FC", pin 4 is labeled "1 RNG", pin 5 is labeled "1 CX1", pin 6 is labeled "NC", pin 7 is labeled "1 CX2", pin 8 is labeled "1 EN", pin 9 is labeled "1Y", pin 10 is labeled "OSC GND", pin 11 is labeled "NC", pin 12 is labeled "GND", pin 13 is labeled "2Y", pin 14 is labeled "2 EN", pin 15 is labeled "2 CX1", pin 16 is labeled "NC", pin 17 is labeled "2 CX2", pin 18 is labeled "2 RNG", pin 19 is labeled "OSC VCC", and pin 20 is labeled "VCC".

NC - No internal connection

While the enable input is low, the output is enabled. While the enable input is high, the output is high.

These devices can operate from a single 5-volt supply. However, one set of supply-voltage and ground pins ( $V_{\rm CC}$  and GND) is provided for the enable, synchronization-gating, and output sections, and a separate set  $\Theta$  V<sub>CC</sub> and  $\Theta$  GND) is provided for the oscillator and associated frequency-control circuits so that effective isolation can be accomplished in the system.

The enable input of these devices starts or stops the output pulses when it is low or high, respectively. The internal oscillator of the 'S124 is started and stopped by the enable input. The enable input is one standard load; it and the buffered output operate at standard Schottky-clamped TTL levels.

The pulse synchronization-gating section ensures that the first output pulse is neither clipped nor extended. Duty cycle of the square-wave output is fixed at approximately 50 percent.

The SN54S124 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of  $-55^{\circ}$ C to 125 $^{\circ}$ C; the SN74S124 is characterized for operation from  $0^{\circ}$ C to  $70^{\circ}$ C.

(1) **Status:** For more details on status, see our product life cycle.

(2) Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assuran reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an ad waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind.

(3) RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.

(4) Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the column width.

(5) MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is sho Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.

(6) **Part marking:** There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the t combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
