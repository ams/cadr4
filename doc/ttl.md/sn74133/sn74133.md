### description

These devices contain a single 13-input NAND gate.

The SN54133 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of  $-55^{\circ} \text{C}$  to 125 $^{\circ} \text{C}$ . The SN74133 is characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

### FUNCTION TABLE

| INPUTS A THRU M      | OUTPUT Y |
|----------------------|----------|
| All inputs H         | L        |
| One or more inputs L | H        |

### logic diagram

Image /page/0/Figure/10 description: The image shows a circuit diagram. On the left side of the diagram, there are 13 inputs labeled A through M, arranged vertically. A vertical line connects all the inputs. Two of the inputs, F and H, are connected to a NAND gate. The output of the NAND gate is labeled Y.

### positive logic

$$Y = \overline{A \cdot B \cdot C \cdot D \cdot E \cdot F \cdot G \cdot H \cdot I \cdot J \cdot K \cdot L \cdot M}$$
 or 
$$Y = \overline{A} + \overline{B} + \overline{C} + \overline{D} + \overline{E} + \overline{F} + \overline{G} + \overline{H} + \overline{I} + \overline{J} + \overline{K} + \overline{L} + \overline{M}$$

Image /page/0/Figure/16 description: The image shows a diagram of an integrated circuit (IC) chip layout. The chip has a polygonal shape with 20 pins arranged around its perimeter. Each pin is labeled with a letter or abbreviation, indicating its function. The pins are numbered from 1 to 20 in a counter-clockwise direction. Specific pin labels include 'B', 'A', 'NC', 'VCC', 'M', 'C', 'D', 'NC', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'GND', 'NC', 'Y', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'NC', 'K', and 'L'. 'NC' likely stands for 'No Connection'. 'VCC' typically represents the power supply voltage, and 'GND' represents ground.

# PACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM

11-Apr-2013

Pb-Free (RoHS): TI's terms "Lead-Free" or "Pb-Free" mean semiconductor products that are compatible with the current RoHS requirements for all 6 substances, including the requirement that lead not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, TI Pb-Free products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. Pb-Free (RoHS Exempt): This component has a RoHS exemption for either 1) lead-based flip-chip solder bumps used between the die and package, or 2) lead-based die adhesive used between the die and leadframe. The component is otherwise considered Pb-Free (RoHS compatible) as defined above.

Green (RoHS & no Sb/Br): TI defines "Green" to mean Pb-Free (RoHS compatible), and free of Bromine (Br) and Antimony (Sb) based flame retardants (Br or Sb do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous material)

(3) MSL. Peak Temp. -- The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) Multiple Top-Side Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Top-Side Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device.

Buyer represents and agrees that it has all the necessary expertise to create and implement safeguards which anticipate dangerous consequences of failures, monitor failures and their consequences, lessen the likelihood of failures that might cause harm and take appropriate remedial actions. Buyer will fully indemnify TI and its representatives against any damages arising out of the use of any TI components in safety-critical applications.

In some cases. TI components may be promoted specifically to facilitate safety-related applications. With such components, TI's goal is to help enable customers to design and create their own end-product solutions that meet applicable functional safety standards and requirements. Nonetheless, such components are subject to these terms.

No TI components are authorized for use in FDA Class III (or similar life-critical medical equipment) unless authorized officers of the parties have executed a special agreement specifically governing such use.

Only those TI components which TI has specifically designated as military grade or "enhanced plastic" are designed and intended for use in military/aerospace applications or environments. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any military or aerospace use of TI components which have **not** been so designated is solely at the Buyer's risk, and that Buyer is solely responsible for compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements in connection with such use.

TI has specifically designated certain components as meeting ISO/TS16949 requirements, mainly for automotive use. In any case of use of non-designated products, TI will not be responsible for any failure to meet ISO/TS16949.
