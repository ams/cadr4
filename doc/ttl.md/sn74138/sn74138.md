##### SDLS014

- **Designed Specifically for High-Speed: Memory Decoders Data Transmission Systems**
- 3 Enable Inputs to Simplify Cascading and/or Data Reception
- Schottky-Clamped for High Performance

### Description

These Schottky-clamped TTL MSI circuits are designed to be used in high-performance memory decoding or data-routing applications requiring very short propagation delay times. In high-performance memory systems, these docoders can be used to minimize the effects of system decoding. When employed with highspeed memories utilizing a fast enable circuit, the delay times of these decoders and the enable time of the memory are usually less than the typical access time of the memory. This means that the effective system delay introduced by the Schottky-clamped system decoder is negligible.

The 'LS138, SN54S138, and SN74S138A decode one of eight lines dependent on the conditions at the three binary select inputs and the three enable inputs. Two active-low and one active-high enable inputs reduce the need for external gates or inverters when expanding. A 24-line decoder can be implemented without external inverters and a 32-line decoder requires only one inverter. An enable input can be used as a data input for demultiplexing applications.

All of these decoder/demultiplexers feature fully buffered inputs, each of which represents only one normalized load to its driving circuit. All inputs are clamped with high-performance Schottky diodes to suppress line-ringing and to simplify system design.

The SN54LS138 and SN54S138 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55°C to 125°C. The SN74LS138 and SN74S138A are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

**ISTRUMENTS** 

Image /page/12/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with labels for its dimensions. The top view of the reel is a circle with a central hub and six spokes connecting the hub to the outer rim. Above the reel is the text "REEL DIMENSIONS". An arrow points from the top of the reel to the bottom, with the label "Reel Diameter" next to it. Below the top view is a side view of the reel, showing its width. An arrow points to the width of the reel, with the label "Reel Width (W1)" next to it.

Image /page/12/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions for a component carrier tape. The diagram includes labels for various dimensions such as A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers. The diagram also shows the location of the cavity in the tape.

#### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/12/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a tape with pockets for holding components. The tape has sprocket holes along the top edge. Each pocket is divided into four quadrants, labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed.

The land pattern consists of two rows of rectangular pads, each with 16 pads. The pads are labeled with dimensions such as 16X (1.85), 16X (0.6), and 14X (1.27). The distance between the two rows of pads is labeled as (7). The pads are numbered from 1 to 8 on the left and 16 to 9 on the right. The image also includes two detailed diagrams illustrating solder mask openings. One diagram shows a non-solder mask defined pad with a 0.07 MAX solder mask opening all around, while the other shows a solder mask defined pad with a 0.07 MIN solder mask opening all around. The diagrams label the metal and solder mask opening. The image also contains the text "LAND PATTERN EXAMPLE SCALE:7X" and "SOLDER MASK DETAILS".
