SDLS013A

- **Designed Specifically for High-Speed: Memory Decoders Data Transmission Systems**
- Two Fully Independent 2- to 4-Line **Decoders/Demultiplexers**
- Schottky Clamped for High Performance ٠

#### description

These Schottky-clamped TTL MSI circuits are designed to be used in high-performance memory-decoding or data-routing applications requiring very short propagation delay times. In high-performance memory systems, these decoders can be used to minimize the effects of system decoding. When employed with highspeed memories utilizing a fast-enable circuit. the delay times of these decoders and the enable time of the memory are usually less than the typical access time of the memory. This means that the effective system delay introduced by the Schottky-clamped system decoder is negligible.

The circuit comprises two individual two-line to four-line decoders in a single package. The active-low enable input can be used as a data line in demultiplexing applications.

All of these decoders/demultiplexers feature fully buffered inputs, each of which represents only one normalized load to its driving circuit. All inputs are clamped with high-performance Schottky diodes to suppress line-ringing and to simplify system design. The SN54LS139A and SN54S139 are characterized for operation range of -55°C to 125°C. The SN74LS139A and SN74S139A are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

SOP

Image /page/11/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a SOP (Small Outline Package) component, along with solder mask details. The land pattern consists of two rows of rectangular pads, each with 16 pads. The pads are labeled with dimensions such as 16X (1.85), 16X (0.6), and 14X (1.27). The distance between the two rows of pads is labeled as (7). The land pattern example is scaled at 7X. The solder mask details show two scenarios: non-solder mask defined and solder mask defined. In the non-solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening extends 0.07 MAX all around the metal pad. In the solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening is smaller, with a 0.07 MIN distance all around the metal pad. The image also includes labels such as METAL, SOLDER MASK OPENING, and SYMM (symmetry).
