Tools &

Software

Each circuit in SNx414 and SNx4LS14 functions as an inverter. However, because of the Schmitt-Trigger action, they have different input threshold levels for positive-going  $(V_{T+})$  and negative-going  $(V_{T-})$  signals.

These circuits are temperature compensated and can be triggered from the slowest of input ramps and still give clean, jitter-free output signals.

## 8 Detailed Description

### 8.1 Overview

The SNx414 and SNx4LS14 Schmitt-Trigger devices contain six independent inverters. They perform the Boolean function  $Y = \overline{A}$  in positive logic.

Schmitt-Trigger inputs are designed to provide a minimum separation between positive and negative switching thresholds. This allows for noisy or slow inputs that would cause problems such as oscillation or excessive current draw with normal CMOS inputs.

### 8.2 Functional Block Diagram

Image /page/12/Figure/7 description: The image shows a logic gate symbol. The input is labeled 'A' and the output is labeled 'Y'. The logic gate is a Schmitt trigger inverter.

### 8.3 Feature Description

The device can operate from very slow transition edge inputs. This device has high noise immunity.

### 8.4 Device Functional Modes

## 9 Application and Implementation

#### NOTE

Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI's customers are responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design implementation to confirm system functionality.

### 9.1 Application Information

The SNx414 and SNx4LS14 device is a Schmitt-Trigger input CMOS device that can be used for a multitude of inverting buffer type functions. The application shown here takes advantage of the Schmitt-Trigger inputs to produce a delay for a logic input.

### 9.2 Typical Application

Image /page/13/Figure/10 description: The image shows a circuit diagram. The circuit consists of two inverters, a resistor, and a capacitor. The input to the circuit is labeled "INPUT" and is connected to the input of the first inverter, labeled "1A". The output of the first inverter, labeled "1Y", is connected to a resistor, labeled "R1". The other end of the resistor is connected to the input of the second inverter, labeled "2A". A capacitor, labeled "C1", is connected between the input of the second inverter and ground. The output of the second inverter, labeled "2Y", is labeled "OUTPUT". The text "Copyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated" is at the bottom of the image.

Figure 28. Simplified Application Schematic

#### 9.2.1 Design Requirements

This device uses CMOS technology. Take care to avoid bus contention because it can drive currents that would exceed maximum limits. Parallel output drive can create fast edges into light loads, so consider routing and load conditions to prevent ringing.

#### 9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

This circuit is designed around an RC network that produces a slow input to the second inverter. The RC time constant ( $\tau$ ) is calculated from:  $\tau = RC$ .

The delay time for this circuit is from  $t_{delay(min)} = -\ln |1 - V_{T+(min)} / V_{CC}| \tau$  to  $t_{delay(max)} = -\ln |1 - V_{T+(max)} / V_{CC}| \tau$ . It must be noted that the delay is consistent for each device, but because the switching threshold is only ensured between the minimum and maximum value, the output pulse length varies between devices. These values must be calculated by using the minimum and maximum ensured V<sub>T+</sub> values in the *Electrical Characteristics*.The resistor value must be chosen such that the maximum current to and from the SNx414/SNx4LS14 is 8 mA at 5-V V<sub>CC</sub>.

The circuit consists of an input line connected to an open-collector output stage, which is enclosed in a dashed rectangle. The output of the open-collector stage is connected to a node labeled 'A'. From node 'A', there is a connection to a capacitor, which is grounded at the other end. Node 'A' is also connected to the input of a Schmitt trigger inverter, which produces the final output of the circuit.

Image /page/15/Figure/11 description: The image shows a timing diagram with two signals labeled "Input" and "Output". The "Input" signal is a rounded square wave, while the "Output" signal is a square wave. The "Input" signal has two threshold levels indicated by dashed lines labeled "VT+" and "VT-". The "Output" signal transitions high when the "Input" signal crosses the "VT+" threshold and transitions low when the "Input" signal crosses the "VT-" threshold.

## 10 Power Supply Recommendations

The power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating located in the Recommended Operating Conditions. The V<sub>CC</sub> terminal must have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. TI recommends using a 0.1- $\mu$ F capacitor on the V<sub>CC</sub> terminal, and must be placed as close as possible to the pin for best results.

## 11 Layout

### 11.1 Layout Guidelines

When using multiple bit logic devices, inputs must never float. In many cases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused, for example, when only two inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used or only three of the four buffer gates are used. Such inputs must not be left unconnected because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. All unused inputs of digital logic devices must be connected to a high or low bias to prevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular unused input depends on the function of the device. Generally they are tied to GND or  $V_{\text{CC}}$ , whichever makes more sense or is more convenient. Floating outputs are generally acceptable, unless the part is a transceiver.

### 11.2 Layout Example

Image /page/16/Figure/9 description: The image shows two diagrams of logic gates. The first diagram has three inputs labeled "Vcc", "Unused Input", and "Input", and one output labeled "Output". The second diagram has two inputs labeled "Input" and "Unused Input", and one output labeled "Output". The "Unused Input" is connected to ground.
