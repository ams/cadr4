#### description

These monolithic data selectors/multiplexers contain full on-chip binary decoding to select the desired data source. The '150 selects one-of-sixteen data sources; the '151A, 'LS151, and 'S151 select one-of-eight data sources. The '150, '151A, 'LS151, and 'S151 have a strobe input which must be at a low logic level to enable these devices. A high level at the strobe forces the W output high, and the Y output (as applicable) low.

The '150 has only an inverted W output; the '151A, 'LS151, and 'S151 feature complementary W and Y outputs.

The '151A and '152A incorporate address buffers that have symmetrical propagation delay times through the complementary paths. This reduces the possibility of transients occurring at the output(s) due to changes made at the select inputs, even when the '151A outputs are enabled (i.e., strobe low).

Image /page/18/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a SOP (Small Outline Package) component, along with solder mask details. The land pattern consists of two rows of rectangular pads, each with 16 pads. The pads are labeled with dimensions such as 16X (1.85), 16X (0.6), and 14X (1.27). The distance between the two rows of pads is labeled as (7). The land pattern example is scaled at 7X. The solder mask details show two scenarios: non-solder mask defined and solder mask defined. In the non-solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening extends 0.07 MAX all around the metal pad. In the solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening is smaller, with a 0.07 MIN distance all around the metal pad. The image also includes labels such as METAL, SOLDER MASK OPENING, and SYMM (symmetry).
