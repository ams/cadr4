# EXAMPLE BOARD LAYOUT

## SOP - 2.00 mm max height

SOP

Image /page/14/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a SOP (Small Outline Package) component, along with solder mask details. The land pattern consists of two rows of rectangular pads, each with 16 pads. The pads are labeled with dimensions such as 16X (1.85), 16X (0.6), and 14X (1.27). The distance between the two rows of pads is labeled as (7). The land pattern example is scaled at 7X. The solder mask details show two scenarios: non-solder mask defined and solder mask defined. In the non-solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening extends 0.07 MAX all around the metal pad. In the solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening is smaller, with a 0.07 MIN distance all around the metal pad. The image also includes labels such as METAL, SOLDER MASK OPENING, and SYMM (symmetry).

NOTES: (continued)
