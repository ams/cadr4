#### Description

These monolithic data selectors/multiplexers contain inverters and drivers to supply full on-chip data selection to the four output gates. A separate strobe input is provided. A 4-bit word is selected from one of two sources and is routed to the four outputs. The '157, 'LS157, and 'S157 present true data whereas the 'LS158 and 'S158 present inverted data to minimize propagation delay time.SN54157, SN54LS157, SN54S157, SN54LS158, SN54S158 ...

 $\frac{1}{2}$  For conditions shown as MIN or MAX, use the appropriate value specified under recommended operating conditions,

- All typical values are at VCC = 5 V, TA- 25°C.

The common anomalisation as many constants of maximum common section of short-circuit should not exceed one second.  $\frac{5}{4}$  All typical values are at  $V_{\text{CC}} = 5$  V,  $T_{\text{A}} = 25^{\circ}$  C,  $\frac{5}{8}$  Not more than one outp

NOTE 2:  $\mathsf{I}_{\text{CC}}$  is measured with 4.5 V applied to all inputs and all outputs open.

 $\ddagger \Delta H$  typical values are at  $V_{\mbox{\small CC}}$  = 5 V,  $T_{\mbox{\small A}}$  =  $25^{\circ}C.$ 

§Not more than one output should be shorted at a time, and duration of the short-circuit should not exceed one second.

Note 2: ICC is measured with all outputs open.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

#### Tape and reel information

STRUMENTS

Image /page/10/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The diagram includes a top view of the reel, showing its circular shape and internal structure, and a side view, illustrating its width. Arrows point to the reel's diameter and width, with the labels "Reel Diameter" and "Reel Width (W1)" respectively. The diagram is titled "REEL DIMENSIONS".

Image /page/10/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions for a component carrier tape. The diagram includes labels for various dimensions such as A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers. The diagram also shows the location of the cavity within the tape.

#### Quadrant assignments for pin 1 orientation in tape

SOP

Image /page/14/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a SOP (Small Outline Package) component, along with solder mask details. The land pattern consists of two rows of rectangular pads, each with 16 pads. The pads are labeled with dimensions such as 16X (1.85), 16X (0.6), and 14X (1.27). The distance between the two rows of pads is labeled as (7). The land pattern example is shown at a scale of 7X. The solder mask details show two different scenarios: non-solder mask defined and solder mask defined. In the non-solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening is larger than the metal pad, with a maximum clearance of 0.07 all around. In the solder mask defined scenario, the solder mask opening is smaller than the metal pad, with a minimum clearance of 0.07 all around. The image also includes labels such as METAL, SOLDER MASK OPENING, SYMM, SEE DETAILS, and (R0.05) TYP.

NOTES: (continued)

5. Publication IPC-7351 may have alternate designs.

6. Solder mask tolerances between and around signal pads can vary based on board fabrication site.

SOP

Image /page/15/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a solder paste example for a surface mount component, likely a small outline package (SOP). The diagram includes dimensions and annotations. There are two rows of rectangular pads, each containing 8 pads. The pads are arranged symmetrically about a central vertical axis. Key dimensions are indicated, such as 16X (1.85) and 16X (0.6) for the pad dimensions, and 14X (1.27) for the spacing between pads. The diagram also includes the annotation (R0.05) TYP, indicating a typical radius of 0.05. The distance between the two rows of pads is labeled as (7). The diagram is labeled as a solder paste example based on a 0.125 mm thick stencil, with a scale of 7X. The numbers 1 and 16 are placed near the top pads on the left and right sides, respectively, and the numbers 8 and 9 are placed near the bottom pads on the left and right sides, respectively. The diagram also includes symmetry symbols labeled SYMM.

NOTES: (continued)
