#### Description

These synchronous, presettable counters feature an internal carry look-ahead for application in high-speed counting designs. The '160,'162,'LS160A,'LS162A, and 'S162 are decade counters and the '161,'163,'LS161A,'LS163A, and 'S163 are 4-bit binary counters. Synchronous operation is provided by having all flip-flops clocked simultaneously so that the outputs change coincident with each other when so instructed by the count-enable inputs and internal gating. This mode of operation eliminates the output counting spikes that are normally associated with asynchronous (ripple clock) counters, however counting spikes may occur on the (RCO) ripple carry output. A buffered clock input triggers the four flip-flops on the rising edge of the clock input waveform.

Image /page/0/Figure/12 description: The image shows a diagram of an integrated circuit (IC) chip, specifically a 74LS192 or similar counter IC. The diagram illustrates the pinout of the chip, indicating the function of each pin. The chip has 16 pins, arranged in two rows of eight pins each. The pins are labeled as follows: Pin 1: CLR (Clear), Pin 2: CLK (Clock), Pin 3: A, Pin 4: B, Pin 5: C, Pin 6: D, Pin 7: ENP (Enable P), Pin 8: GND (Ground), Pin 9: LOAD, Pin 10: ENT (Enable T), Pin 11: QD, Pin 12: QC, Pin 13: QB, Pin 14: QA, Pin 15: RCO (Ripple Carry Out), Pin 16: VCC (Power Supply).

NC-No internal connection

Image /page/0/Figure/14 description: The image shows a diagram of a SERIES 54LS', 54S' FK PACKAGE (TOP VIEW). The diagram shows the pinout of the integrated circuit, with the pin numbers and their corresponding functions labeled. The pins are arranged around the perimeter of the package, with pins 1 to 10 on the left side and pins 11 to 20 on the right side. The pin functions are as follows: 1: NC, 2: CLR, 3: CLK, 4: A, 5: B, 6: NC, 7: C, 8: D, 9: ENP, 10: GND, 11: NC, 12: LOAD, 13: ENT, 14: QD, 15: QC, 16: NC, 17: QB, 18: QA, 19: RCO, 20: VCC. The diagram also includes a note that NC stands for No internal connection.

These counters are fully programmable; that is, the outputs may be preset to either level. As presetting is synchronous, setting up a low level at the load input disables the counter and causes the outputs to agree with the setup data after the next clock pulse regardless of the levels of the enable inputs. Low-to-high transitions at the load input of the '160 thru '163 should be avoided when the clock is low if the enable inputs are high at or before the transition. This restriction is not applicable to the 'LS160A thru 'LS163A or 'S162 or 'S163. The clear function for the '160, '161, 'LS160A, and 'LS161A is asynchronous and a low level at the clear input sets all four of the flip-flop outputs low regardless of the levels of clock, load, or enable inputs. The clear function for the '162,'163,'LS162A,'LS163A, 'S162, and 'S163 is synchronous and a low level at the clear input sets all four of the flip-flop outputs low after the next clock pulse, regardless of the levels of the enable inputs. This synchronous clear allows the count length to be modified easily as decoding the maximum count desired can be accomplished with one external NAND gate. The gate output is connected to the clear input to synchronously clear the counter to 0000 (LLLL). Low-to-high transitions at the clear input of the '162 and '163 should be avoided when the clock is low if the enable and load inputs are high at or before the transition.

The carry look-ahead circuitry provides for cascading counters for n-bit synchronous applications without additional gating. Instrumental in accomplishing this function are two count-enable inputs and a ripple carry output. Both count-enable inputs (P and T) must be high to count, and input T is fed forward to enable the ripple carry output. The ripple carry output thus enabled will produce a high-level output pulse with a duration approximately equal to the high-level portion of the  $Q_{\Delta}$  output. This high-level overflow ripple carry pulse can be used to enable successive cascaded stages. High-to-low-level transitions at the enable P or T inputs of the '160 thru '163 should occur only when the clock input is high. Transitions at the enable P or T inputs of the 'LS160A thru 'LS163A or 'S162 and 'S163 are allowed regardless of the level of the clock input.

'LS160A thru 'LS163A,'S162 and 'S163 feature a fully independent clock circuit. Changes at control inputs (enable P or T, or load) that will modify the operating mode have no effect until clocking occurs. The function of the counter (whether enabled, disabled, loading, or counting) will be dictated solely by the conditions meeting the stable setup and hold times.

### electrical characteristics over recommended operating free-air temperature range (unless otherwise noted)

<sup>†</sup>For conditions shown as MIN or MAX, use the appropriate value specified under recommended operating conditions.

 $\ddagger$  All typical values are at V<sub>CC</sub> = 5 V, T<sub>A</sub> = 25 °C.

 $\delta$ Not more than one output should be shorted at a time, and duration of the short-circuit should not exceed one second.

NOTES: 3. ICCH is measured with the load input high, then again with the load input low, with all other inputs high and all outputs open.

4. ICCL is measured with the clock input high, then again with the clock input low, with all other inputs low and all outputs open.

### switching characteristics, $V_{CC} = 5 \text{ V}$ , $T_A = 25^{\circ} \text{C}$

### TYPICAL APPLICATION DATA

This application demonstrates how the ripple mode carry circuit (Figure 1) and the carry-look-ahead circuit (Figure 2) can be used to implement a high-speed N-bit counter. The '160, '162, 'LS160A, 'LS162A, or 'S162 will count in BCD and the '161, '163, 'LS161A, 'LS163A, or 'S163 will count in binary. When additional stages are added the fMAX decreases in Figure 1, but remains unchanged in Figure 2.

Image /page/20/Figure/4 description: The image shows a digital circuit diagram with four identical blocks connected in series. Each block has inputs labeled "LD", "A", "B", "C", and "D" at the top, and "EN P" and "EN T" on the side, with notes indicating "H = COUNT" and "L = DISABLE" for these inputs. Each block also has a clock input "CK", a clear input "CLR", and outputs labeled "QA", "QB", "QC", and "QD". The output of each block is labeled "RCO" and is connected to the "EN T" input of the next block. The "RCO" output of the last block is labeled "TO MORE SIGNIFICANT STAGES". The "CLR" and "CLK" inputs are connected to all four blocks.

#### N-BIT SYNCHRONOUS COUNTERS
