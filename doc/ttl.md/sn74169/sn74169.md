#### description

These synchronous presettable counters feature an internal carry look-ahead for cascading in high speed counting applications. The 'LS169B and 'S169 are 4-bit binary counters. Synchronous operation is provided by having all flip-flops clocked simultaneously so that the outputs change coincident with each other when so instructed by the countenable inputs and internal gating. This mode of operation helps eliminate the output counting spikes that are normally associated with asynchronous (ripple-clock) counters. A buffered clock input triggers the four master-slave flip-flops on the rising (positivegoing) edge of the clock waveform.

These counters are fully programmable; that is the outputs may each be preset to either level. The load input circuitry allows loading with the carry-enable output of cascaded counters. As loading is synchronous, setting up a low level at the load input disables the counter and causes the outputs to agree with the data inputs after the next clock pulse.

The carry look-ahead circuitry provides for cascading counters for n-bit synchronous applications without additional gating. Instrumental in accomplishing this function are two count-enable inputs and a carry output. Both count enable inputs (ENP, ENT) must be low to count. The direction of the count is determined by the level of the up/down input. When the input is high, the counter counts up; when low, it counts down. Input ENT is fed forward to enable the carry output. The carry output thus enabled will produce a low-level output pulse with a duration approximately equal to the high portion of the QA output when counting up and approximately equal to the low portion of the QA output when counting down. This low-level overflow carry pulse can be used to enable successive cascaded stages. Transitions at the ENP or ENT inputs are allowed regardless of the level of the clock input. All inputs are diode-clamped to minimize transmission-line effects, thereby simplifying system design.

These counters feature a fully independent clock circuit. Changes at control inputs (ENP, ENT, LOAD, U/D) that will modify the operating mode have no effect until clocking occurs. The function of the counter (whether enabled, disabled, loading, or counting) will be dictated solely by the conditions meeting the stable setup and hold times.

🖞 Propagation delay time from up/down to ripple carry must be measured with the counter at either a minimum or a maximum count. As the logic level of the up/down input is changed, the ripple carry output will follow. If the count is minimum (0), the ripple carry output transistion will be in phase. If the count is maximum (15), the ripple carry output will be out of phase.

# switching characteristics, $V_{CC} = 5 \text{ V}$ , $T_A = 25^{\circ} \text{C}$

 $t_{\text{max}}$  = maximum clock frequency

tp<sub>LH</sub> = propagation delay time, low-to-high-level output

 $tp_{\text{HL}}$  = propagation delay time, high-to-low-level output

Propagation delay time from up/down to ripple carry must be measured with the counter at either a minimum or a maximum count. As the logic level of the up/down input is changed, the ripple carry output will follow. If the count is minimum (O), the ripple carry output transition will be in phase. If the count is maximum (15 for 'S169), the ripple carry output will be out of phase.

Image /page/9/Figure/2 description: The image shows a timing diagram titled "PARAMETER MEASUREMENT INFORMATION" with voltage waveforms for various input signals. The signals include CLK INPUT, LOAD INPUT, DATA INPUTS (A, B, C, and D), ENP or ENT, and U/D INPUT. Each signal's waveform is plotted against time, showing transitions between voltage levels, marked as 3V and 0V. Key timing parameters such as t\_w(clock), t\_su (setup time), and t\_h (hold time) are indicated with arrows and labels. The reference voltage, V\_ref, is also marked on the waveforms. The diagram includes a note stating that the input pulses are supplied by a generator with specific characteristics: PRR ≤ 1 MHz, duty cycle ≤ 50%, and Z\_out ≈ 50 Ω.

- NOTES: A. The input pulses are supplied by a generator having the following characteristics: PRR  $\leq$  1 MHz, duty cycle  $\leq$  50%, Z<sub>out</sub>  $\approx$  50  $\Omega$ ; for 'LS169B,  $t_f \leq 15$  ns;  $t_f \leq 6$  ns, and for 'S169,  $t_f \leq 2.5$  ns,  $t_f \leq 2.5$  ns.
  - B. For 'LS169B,  $V_{ref}$  = 1.3 V; for 'S168 and 'S169,  $V_{ref}$  = 1.5 V.

FIGURE 1-PULSE WIDTHS, SETUP TIMES, HOLD TIMESImage /page/9/Figure/6 description: The image shows two timing diagrams, one for ENT INPUT and one for RCO. The ENT INPUT diagram shows a signal that transitions from 3V to 0V and then back to 3V. The RCO diagram shows a signal that transitions from VOL to VOH and then back to VOL. The diagrams also show the parameters tPHL and tPLH, which represent the propagation delay from high to low and from low to high, respectively. The diagrams also show the reference voltage, Vref.

VOLTAGE WAVEFORMS

- NOTES: A. The input pulses are supplied by a generator having the following characteristics: PRR  $\leq$  MHz, duty cycle  $\leq$  50%, Z<sub>out</sub>  $\approx$  50  $\Omega$ ; for 'LS169B,  $t_r \leq 15$  ns,  $t_f \leq 5$  ns; and for 'S169,  $t_r \leq 2.5$  ns,  $t_f \leq 2.5$  ns.
  - B. tpLH and tpHL from enable T input to ripple carry output assume that the counter is at the maximum count, all Q outputs high.
  - C. For 'LS169B,  $V_{\text{ref}}$  = 1.3 V; for 'S169,  $V_{\text{ref}}$  = 1.5 V.
  - D. Propagation delay time from up/down to ripple carry must be measured with the counter at either a minimum or a maximum count. As the logic level of the up/down input is changed, the ripple carry output will follow. If the count is minimum (0) the ripple carry output transition will be in phase. If the count is maximum (15), the ripple carry output will be out of phase.
