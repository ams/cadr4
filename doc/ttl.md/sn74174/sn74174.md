#### description

These monolithic, positive-edge-triggered flip-flops utilize TTL circuitry to implement D-type flip-flop logic. All have a direct clear input, and the '175, 'LS175, and 'S175 feature complementary outputs from each flipflop.

Information at the D inputs meeting the setup time requirements is transferred to the Q outputs on the positive-going edge of the clock pulse. Clock triggering occurs at a particular voltage level and is not directly related to the transition time of the positive-going pulse. When the clock input is at either the high or low level, the D input signal has no effect at the output.

These circuits are fully compatible for use with most TTL circuits.

 $^{\dagger}$ For conditions shown as MIN or MAX, use the appropriate value specified under recommended operating conditions.

 $\ddagger$  All typical values are at V<sub>CC</sub> = 5 V, T<sub>A</sub> = 25 $^{\circ}$ C.

 $\S$  Not more than one output should be shorted at a time, and duration of the short-circuit should not exceed one second.

NOTE 2: With all outputs open and 4.5 V applied to all data and clear inputs, I<sub>CC</sub> is measured after a momentary ground, then 4.5 V, is applied to clock.

 $^\dagger$ For conditions shown as MIN or MAX, use the appropriate value specified under recommended operating conditions for the applicable device type.

‡ All typical values are at VCC = 5 V, TA = 25°C.

 $\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}$  All typical values are at V<sub>CC</sub> = 5 V, T<sub>A</sub> = 25<sup>o</sup>C.<br>  $\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}$  Not more than one output should be shorted at a time, and duration of the short-circuit should not exceed one second.

NOTE 2: With all outputs open and 4.5 V applied to all data and clear inputs, I<sub>CC</sub> is measured after a momentary ground, then 4.5 V, is applied to clock.

## switching characteristics, $V_{CC} = 5 \text{ V}$ , $T_A = 25^{\circ}\text{C}$

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

NRND: Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

**STRUMENTS** 

Image /page/10/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The diagram includes a top view of the reel, showing its circular shape and internal structure, and a side view, illustrating its width. Arrows point to the reel's diameter and width, with the labels "Reel Diameter" and "Reel Width (W1)" respectively. The diagram is titled "REEL DIMENSIONS".

Image /page/10/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions for a component carrier tape. The diagram includes labels for various dimensions, such as A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers. The diagram also shows the location of the cavity in the tape.

#### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/10/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a tape with sprocket holes along the top edge. There are three pockets shown, each divided into four quadrants labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed, and a label indicates that the pockets are called "Pocket Quadrants".
