#### description

The SN54S182 and SN74S182 are high-speed, look-ahead carry generators capable of anticipating a carry across four binary adders or group of adders. They are cascadable to perform full look-ahead across n-bit adders. Carry, generatecarry, and propagate-carry functions are provided as enumerated in the pin designation table above.

When used in conjunction with the 'LS181 or 'S181 arithmetic logic unit (ALU), these generators provide high-speed carry look-ahead capability for any word length. Each 'S182 generates the look-ahead (anticipated carry) across a group of four ALUs and, in addition, other carry look-ahead circuits may be employed to anticipate carry across sections of four look-ahead packages up to n-bits. The method of cascading 'S182 circuits to perform multilevel look-ahead is illustrated under typical application data.

The carry functions (inputs, outputs, generate, and propagate) of the look-ahead generators are implemented in the compatible forms for direct connection to the ALU. Reinterpretations of carry functions as explained on the 'LS181 and 'S181 data sheet are also applicable to and compatible with the look-ahead generator. Logic equations for the 'S182 are:

 $C_{n+x} = G0 + P0 
ormal C_n$   
 $C_{n+y} = G1 + P1 
ormal G0 + P1 
ormal P0 
ormal C_n$   
 $C_{n+z} = G2 + P2 
ormal G1 + P2 
ormal P1

ormal P1 
ormal P0 
ormal C_n$  or  
 $\overline{G} = G3 + P3

ormal P2 
ormal P1 
ormal G0$   
 $\overline{P} = P3 
ormal P2 
ormal P1 
ormal P0$  $\overline{C}_{n+x} = \overline{Y0 (X0 + C_n)}$   
 $\overline{C}_{n+y} = \overline{Y1 [X1 + Y0 (X0 + C_n)]}$   
 $\overline{C}_{n+z} = \overline{Y2 \{ X2 + Y1 [X1 + Y0 (X0 + C_n)] \}}$

Image /page/2/Figure/3 description: The image shows two circuit diagrams, one labeled "EQUIVALENT OF EACH INPUT" and the other labeled "TYPICAL OF ALL OUTPUTS". The "EQUIVALENT OF EACH INPUT" diagram shows a circuit with a transistor, diodes, and a resistor labeled "Req". Next to the diagram is a table listing different inputs (Cn, P3, P2, P0, P1, G3, G0, G4, G1) and their corresponding Req values in ohms or kilo-ohms. The "TYPICAL OF ALL OUTPUTS" diagram shows a circuit with transistors and resistors, with a resistor labeled "50 Ω NOM" connected to VCC and an output labeled "OUTPUT".

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

RoHS Exempt: TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL. Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.
