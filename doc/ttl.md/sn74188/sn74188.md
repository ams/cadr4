# **Block Diagram**

Image /page/0/Figure/14 description: The image shows a schematic diagram of a memory system. The diagram includes a decoder labeled "DECODER" with inputs A0, A1, A2, A3, and A4. The decoder has an output labeled "1/32" that connects to a 256-BIT ARRAY, which is described as a 32 x 8 MEMORY MATRIX. Below the decoder is an ENABLE BUFFER with an input labeled "G". The output of the ENABLE BUFFER connects to a series of eight buffers labeled BUF. The outputs of these buffers are labeled Q7, Q6, Q5, Q4, Q3, Q2, Q1, and Q0.

## **Functional Description**

### TESTABILITY

The Schottky PROM die includes extra rows and columns of fusable links for testing the programmability of each chip. These test fuses are placed at the worst-case chip locations to provide the highest possible confidence in the programming tests in the final product. A ROM pattern is also permanently fixed in the additional circuitry and coded to provide a parity check of input address levels. These and other test circuits are used to test for correct operation of the row and column-select circuits and functionality of input and enable gates. All test circuits are available at both wafer and assembled device levels to allow 100% functional and parametric testing at every stage of the test flow.

### RELIABILITY

As with all National products, the Ti-W PROMs are subjected to an on-going reliability evaluation by the Reliability Assurance Department. These evaluations employ accelerated life tests, including dynamic high-temperature operating life, temperature-humidity life, temperature cycling, and thermal shock. To date, nearly 7.4 million Schottky Ti-W PROM device hours have been logged, with samples in Epoxy B molded DIP (N-package), PLCC (V-package) and CERDIP (J-package). Device performance in all package configurations is excellent.

### TITANIUM-TUNGSTEN FUSES

National's Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs) feature titanium-tungsten (Ti-W) fuse links designed to program efficiently with only 10.5V applied. The high performance and reliability of these PROMs are the result of fabrication by a Schottky bipolar process, of which the titaniumtungsten metallization is an integral part, and the use of an on-chip programming circuit.

A major advantage of the titanium-tungsten fuse technology is the low programming voltage of the fuse links. At 10.5V, this virtually eliminates the need for guard-ring devices and wide spacings required for other fuse technologies. Care is taken, however, to minimize voltage drops across the die and to reduce parasitics. The device is designed to ensure that worst-case fuse operating current is low enough for reliable long-term operation. The Darlington programming circuit is liberally designed to insure adequate power density for blowing the fuse links. The complete circuit design is optimized to provide high performance over the entire operating ranges of  $V_{CC}$  and temperature.
