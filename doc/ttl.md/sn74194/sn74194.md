## description

These bidirectional shift registers are designed to incorporate virtually all of the features a system designer may want in a shift register. The circuit contains 46 equivalent gates and features parallel inputs, parallel outputs, right-shift and left-shift serial inputs, operating-mode-control inputs, and a direct overriding clear line. The register has four distinct modes of operation, namely:

Inhibit clock (do nothing) Shift right (in the direction Q<sub>A</sub> toward Q<sub>D</sub>) Shift left (in the direction  $Q_D$  toward  $Q_A$ ) Parallel (broadside) load

Synchronous parallel loading is accomplished by applying the four bits of data and taking both mode control inputs, S0 and S1, high. The data are loaded into the associated flip-flops and appear at the outputs after the positive transition of the clock input. During loading, serial data flow is inhibited.

Shift right is accomplished synchronously with the rising edge of the clock pulse when SO is high and S1 is low. Serial data for this mode is entered at the shift-right data input. When S0 is low and S1 is high, data shifts left synchronously and new data is entered at the shift-left serial input.

Clocking of the shift register is inhibited when both mode control inputs are low. The mode controls of the SN54194/SN74194 should be changed only while the clock input is high.

Each IC has two diagrams: one representing the equivalent circuit for each input and another representing the typical circuit for all outputs. For the '194, the input circuit includes a transistor and diodes, with the input resistance (Req) specified as 4 kΩ for the CLK input and 6 kΩ for all other inputs. The output circuit consists of a transistor and diodes, with a 100 Ω resistor connected to VCC. For the 'LS194A, there are two input circuits: one for R, L, A, B, C, and D inputs with a 15 kΩ resistor, and another for CLEAR, CLOCK, S0, and S1 inputs with a 17 kΩ resistor. The output circuit includes transistors and resistors, with a 120 Ω resistor connected to VCC. For the 'S194, the input circuit is similar to the '194, with Req specified as 4 kΩ for CLR, S0, and S1 inputs and 2.8 kΩ for all other inputs. The output circuit includes transistors and resistors, with a 50 Ω resistor connected to VCC.

Image /page/8/Figure/6 description: The image shows voltage waveforms for a digital circuit, including signals for CLEAR, CLOCK, DATA INPUT, and OUTPUT Q. The waveforms illustrate timing parameters such as setup time (tsu), hold time (th), pulse width (tw), and propagation delays (tPHL, tPLH). Voltage levels are indicated as 3V, 0V, Vref, VOH, and VOL. The waveforms are labeled with timing parameters and voltage levels to describe the behavior of the digital circuit.

- B. C<sub>1</sub> includes probe and jig capacitance.
- C. All diodes are 1N3064 or 1N916.
- D. A clear pulse is applied prior to each test.
- E. For '194 and '5194,  $V_{ref} = 1.5$  V; for 'LS194A,  $V_{ref} = 1.3$  V.<br>F. Propagation delay times (tp<sub>LH</sub> and tp<sub>HL</sub>) are measured at t<sub>n+1</sub>. Proper shifting of data is verified at t<sub>n+4</sub> with a functional test.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows: **ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

Image /page/11/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words "PACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM" in large, bold, black letters. The words are arranged in three lines, with "PACKAGE" on the first line, "OPTION" on the second line, and "ADDENDUM" on the third line. The background is white.

Image /page/11/Picture/1 description: The image shows the logo for Texas Instruments. The logo consists of a red stylized "TI" symbol on the left, followed by the words "TEXAS INSTRUMENTS" in a dark gray, serif font.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect. **NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design. **PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available. **OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

RoHS Exempt: TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption. Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.
