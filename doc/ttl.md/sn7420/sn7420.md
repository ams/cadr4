Image /page/0/Figure/9 description: The image shows a diagram of a logic gate, specifically a dual 4-input AND gate. The top gate has inputs labeled 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D, connected to pins (1), (2), (4), and (5) respectively. The output of the top gate is labeled 1Y and is connected to pin (6). The bottom gate has inputs labeled 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D, connected to pins (9), (10), (12), and (13) respectively. The output of the bottom gate is labeled 2Y and is connected to pin (8). The symbol '&' is shown inside the top gate, indicating that it is an AND gate.

<sup>†</sup>This symbol is in accordance with ANSI/IEEE Std. 91-1984 and IEC Publication 617-12.

Pin numbers shown are for D, J, N, and W packages.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS**: TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Image /page/8/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Texas Instruments. On the left is a red symbol that resembles the state of Texas with the letters 'ti' inside. To the right of the symbol is the text 'TEXAS INSTRUMENTS' in a dark, sans-serif font.

## PACKAGE OPTION ADDENDUM

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the <=1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

#### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

ISTRUMENTS

Image /page/9/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The diagram includes two views of the reel: a front view and a side view. The front view shows the circular shape of the reel with a central hub and six spokes connecting the hub to the outer rim. The side view shows the thickness of the reel. Arrows point to the reel diameter in the front view and the reel width (W1) in the side view, indicating these dimensions.

Image /page/9/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions. The diagram includes labels for A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width. B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length. K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness. W is the overall width of the carrier tape. P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers.

#### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/9/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a tape with sprocket holes and pocket quadrants. The sprocket holes are located at the top of the tape, and the pocket quadrants are located in the middle of the tape. The pocket quadrants are labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. The user direction of feed is indicated by an arrow pointing to the right.
