### **8 Detailed Description**

### 8.1 Overview

This device is organized as two 4-bit buffers and drivers with separate output-enable  $(\overline{G})$  inputs. When  $\overline{G}$  is low, the device passes data from the A inputs to the Y outputs. When  $\overline{G}$  is high, the outputs are in the high impedance state. Inputs can be driven from either 3.3-V or 5-V devices. This feature allows the use of this device as a translator in a mixed 3.3-V and 5-V system environment. To ensure the high-impedance state during power up or power down,  $\overline{G}$  must be tied to  $V_{CC}$  through a pullup resistor; the minimum value of the resistor is determined by the current-sinking capability of the driver.

### 8.2 Functional Block Diagrams

Image /page/10/Figure/7 description: The image shows a circuit diagram with two sets of four inverting buffers. The first set of buffers has inputs labeled 1G (pin 1), 1A1 (pin 2), 1A2 (pin 4), 1A3 (pin 6), and 1A4 (pin 8). The outputs of these buffers are connected to pins 18 (1Y1), 16 (1Y2), 14 (1Y3), and 12 (1Y4), respectively. The second set of buffers has inputs labeled 2G (pin 19), 2A1 (pin 11), 2A2 (pin 13), 2A3 (pin 15), and 2A4 (pin 17). The outputs of these buffers are connected to pins 9 (2Y1), 7 (2Y2), 5 (2Y3), and 3 (2Y4), respectively.

## 9 Application and Implementation

#### NOTE

Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI's customers are responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes. Customers should validate and test their design implementation to confirm system functionality.

### 9.1 Application Information

The SNx4LS24x, SNx4S24x octal buffers and line drivers are designed to be used for a multitude of bus interface type applications where output drive or PCB trace length is a concern.

### 9.2 Typical Application

Image /page/13/Figure/9 description: This image shows a diagram of a long-line communication system with repeaters. The system consists of a driver, three repeaters, and a receiver, all labeled as 1/8 'LS241/'S241. The driver is connected to the input, and the receiver is connected to the output. The repeaters are placed along the long line to amplify the signal. The diagram also includes waveforms showing the signal at the input and output of each component. The waveforms show that the signal degrades as it travels along the line, but the repeaters help to restore the signal strength. The waveforms are labeled with voltage levels of 2.9 V, 1.6 V, 1.2 V, and 0.3 V. The image also includes a copyright notice for Texas Instruments Incorporated.

Image /page/13/Figure/10 description: The image is a title that reads "Figure 22. SNx4LS241 and SNx4S241 Used as Repeater or Level Restorer".

#### 9.2.1 Design Requirements

This device uses Schottky transistor logic technology. Take care to avoid bus contention because it can drive currents that would exceed maximum limits. The high drive creates fast edges into light loads, so routing and load conditions must be considered to prevent ringing.

#### 9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure

- Power Supply
  - Each device must maintain a supply voltage between 4.5 V and 5.5 V.
- Inputs
  - Input signals must meet the  $V_{IH}$  and  $V_{IL}$  specifications in *Electrical Characteristics SNx4LS24x*.
  - Inputs leakage values ( $I_{\text{I}}$ ,  $I_{\text{II}}$ ,  $I_{\text{II}}$ ) from *Electrical Characteristics*  $SNx4LS24x$  must be considered.
- Outputs
  - Output signals are specified to meet the V<sub>OH</sub> and V<sub>OL</sub> specifications in *Electrical Characteristics* - $SNx4LS24x$  as a minimum (the values could be closer to  $V_{CC}$  for high signals or GND for low signals).
  - TI recommends maintaining output currents as specified in *Recommended Operating Conditions*.
  - The part can be damaged by sourcing or sinking too much current (see *Electrical Characteristics* -SNx4LS24x for details).

### 10 Power Supply Recommendations

The power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating located in Recommended Operating Conditions. Each  $V_{\text{CC}}$  pin must have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For devices with a single supply, TI recommends a 0.1- $\mu$ F bypass capacitor. If there are multiple  $V_{\rm CC}$  pins, TI recommends a 0.01- $\mu$ F or 0.022- $\mu$ F bypass capacitors for each power pin. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass capacitors to reject different frequencies of noise. Two bypass capacitors of value 0.1 µF and  $1 \mu F$  are commonly used in parallel. For best results, install the bypass capacitor(s) as close to the power pin as possible.

## 11 Layout

### 11.1 Layout Guidelines

When using multiple bit logic devices, inputs must not be left floating. In many applications, some channels of the SNx4LS24x, SNx4S24x are unused, and thus must be terminated properly. Because each transceiver channel pin can be either an input or an output, they must be treated as both when being terminated. Ground or  $V_{\rm CC}$ (whichever is more convenient) can be used to terminate unused inputs; however, each unused channel should be terminated to the same logic level on both the A and Y side. For example, in Figure 27 unused channels are terminated correctly with both sides connected to the same voltage, while channel 8 is terminated incorrectly with each side being tied to a different voltage. The  $\overline{G}$  input is also unused in this example, and is terminated directly to ground to permanently enable all outputs.

### 11.2 Layout Example

Image /page/16/Figure/10 description: The image shows two different logic gate diagrams. The first diagram has three inputs on the left side of the gate, labeled "VCC", "Unused Input", and "Input". There is one output on the right side of the gate, labeled "Output". The "VCC" input has a small circle at the end of the line. The second diagram has two inputs on the left side of the gate, labeled "Input" and "Unused Input". The "Unused Input" is connected to ground. There is one output on the right side of the gate, labeled "Output".
