### description

These devices are designed to multiplex signals from four-bit data sources to four-output data lines in busorganized systems. The 3-state outputs will not load the data lines when the output control pin (G) is at a highlogic level.

Series 54LS and 54S are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of  $-55^{\circ}$ C to 125°C; Series 74LS and 74S are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

 $f_{max}$  = Maximum clock frequency

 $tp_{LH}$  = propagation delay time, low-to-high-level output

 $t_{\text{PHL}}$  = propagation delay time, high-to-low-level output

 $tp_{ZH}$  = output enable time to high level

NOTE 3: Load circuits and voltage waveforms are shown in Section 1.

tpZL ≡ output enable time to low level

 $t_{\mbox{PHZ}} \equiv$  output disable time from high level  $t_{\mbox{PLZ}} \equiv$  output disable time from low level

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) Eco Plan - The planned eco-friendly classification: Pb-Free (RoHS) or Green (RoHS & no Sb/Br) - please check http://www.ti.com/productcontent for the latest availability information and additional product content details. **TBD:** The Pb-Free/Green conversion plan has not been defined.

Pb-Free (RoHS): TI's terms "Lead-Free" or "Pb-Free" mean semiconductor products that are compatible with the current RoHS requirements for all 6 substances, including the requirement that lead not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, TI Pb-Free products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes.

Green (RoHS & no Sb/Br): TI defines "Green" to mean Pb-Free (RoHS compatible), and free of Bromine (Br) and Antimony (Sb) based flame retardants (Br or Sb do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous material)

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. -- The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

CERAMIC DUAL IN-LINE PACKAGE

Image /page/9/Figure/2 description: The image shows a technical drawing of an integrated circuit (IC) package, specifically a dual in-line package (DIP). The drawing includes dimensions and specifications for different pin counts (14, 16, 18, and 20 pins). There are three views of the package: a top view, a side view, and an end view. The dimensions are provided in both inches and millimeters. A table provides specific dimensions (labeled A, B, and C) for each pin count. For example, for a 14-pin package, dimension A is 0.300 inches (7.62 mm), dimension B (max) is 0.785 inches (19.94 mm), and dimension C (max) is 0.300 inches (7.62 mm). The drawing also includes notes indicating that all linear dimensions are in inches (millimeters).

NOTES: A. All linear dimensions are in inches (millimeters).

- B. This drawing is subject to change without notice.
- C. This package is hermetically sealed with a ceramic lid using glass frit.
- D. Index point is provided on cap for terminal identification only on press ceramic glass frit seal only.
- E. Falls within MIL STD 1835 GDIP1-T14, GDIP1-T16, GDIP1-T18 and GDIP1-T20.
