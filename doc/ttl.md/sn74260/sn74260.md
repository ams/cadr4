### description

These devices contain two independent 5-input positive -NOR gates. They perform the Boolean function  $Y = \overline{A + B + C + D + E}$  in positive logic.The SN54S260 is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of  $-55^{\circ}\text{C}$  to  $125^{\circ}\text{C}$ . The SN74S260 is characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

### logic diagram (each gate)

Image /page/0/Figure/9 description: The image shows a schematic diagram of a digital logic gate. The gate has five inputs labeled A, B, C, D, and E on the left side. The output of the gate is labeled Y on the right side. The gate symbol resembles a NOR gate, indicated by the OR gate shape with a small circle at the output, which signifies the inversion.

### logic symbol<sup> </sup>

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL. Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width

## TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

STRUMENTS

Image /page/5/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The diagram includes a top view of the reel, showing its diameter, and a side view, showing its width (W1). The reel has a circular shape with a central hub and six spokes connecting the hub to the outer rim. The top view shows the reel's diameter, which is the distance across the reel from one edge to the opposite edge. The side view shows the reel's width (W1), which is the distance between the two sides of the reel. The diagram is labeled with the text "REEL DIMENSIONS", "Reel Diameter", and "Reel Width (W1)".

Image /page/5/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions. The diagram includes labels for A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width. B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length. K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness. W is the overall width of the carrier tape. P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers.

### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/5/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a component carrier tape with sprocket holes and pocket quadrants. The sprocket holes are located along the top edge of the tape. The pocket quadrants are located in the center of the tape, and are labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed.

CERAMIC DUAL IN LINE PACKAGE

Image /page/11/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a ceramic dual in-line package. The pattern consists of 14 pads on each side, with the pads on each side being symmetrical. The pads are arranged in a line, with a spacing of 0.100 inches (2.54 mm) between each pad. The pads are 0.039 inches (1 mm) in diameter. The land pattern example is non-solder mask defined and is shown at a scale of 5X. There are also two detailed views of the pads, labeled "DETAIL A" and "DETAIL B". Detail A shows a square pad with a solder mask opening, and Detail B shows a circular pad with a solder mask opening. The details are shown at scales of 15X and 13X, respectively.
