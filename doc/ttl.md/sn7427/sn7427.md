Image /page/1/Figure/1 description: The image shows two circuit diagrams labeled '27 and 'LS27, each representing schematics for a gate. The '27 circuit includes inputs A, B, and C, connected to transistors and resistors (4 kΩ, 1.6 kΩ, 130 Ω, and 1 kΩ), leading to an output Y and a ground (GND). The 'LS27 circuit also has inputs A, B, and C, connected to a network of resistors (20 kΩ, 8 kΩ, 120 Ω, 10 kΩ, 4 kΩ, 1.5 kΩ, and 3 kΩ) and transistors, resulting in an output Y and a ground (GND). The image also includes absolute maximum ratings over operating free-air temperature range, listing a supply voltage (VCC) of 7V, input voltage of 5.5V for '27 and 7V for 'LS27, operating free-air temperature of -55°C to 125°C for SN54' and 0°C to 70°C for SN74', and a storage temperature range of -65°C to 150°C.

Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assuran reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an ad waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind.

(3) RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.

(4) Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the column width.

(5) MSL ratina/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is sho Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.

(6) **Part marking:** There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the t combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
