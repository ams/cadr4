- Buffered Clock and Direct Clear Inputs
- Individual Data Input to Each Flip-Flop
- Applications Include: **Buffer/Storage Registers Shift Registers Pattern Generators**

#### description

These monolithic, positive-edge-triggered flipflops utilize TTL circuitry to implement D-type flip-flop logic with a direct clear input.

Information at the D inputs meeting the setup time requirements is transferred to the Q outputs on the positive-going edge of the clock pulse. Clock triggering occurs at a particular voltage level and is not directly related to the transition time of the positive-going pulse. When the clock input is at either the high or low level, the D input signal has no effect ar the output.

These flip-flops are guaranteed to respond to clock frequencies ranging form 0 to 30 megahertz while maximum clock frequency is typically 40 megahertz. Typical power dissipation is 39 milliwatts per flip-flop for the '273 and 10 milliwatts for the 'LS273.

NOTE 2: With all outputs open and 4.5 V applied to all data and clear inputs, I<sub>CC</sub> is measured after a momentary ground, then 4.5 V, is applied to clock.

## switching characteristics, $V_{CC} = 5 \text{ V}$ , $T_A = 25^{\circ}\text{C}$

### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

STRUMENTS

Image /page/5/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with labels for its dimensions. The top part of the diagram shows a front view of the reel, which is circular with six spokes connecting the center to the outer rim. Above the reel, the text "REEL DIMENSIONS" is written. An arrow points from the top of the reel to the bottom, with the label "Reel Diameter" next to it. Below the front view, there is a side view of the reel, showing its width. An arrow points to the width of the reel, with the label "Reel Width (W1)" next to it.

Image /page/5/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions for a component. The diagram includes labels for various dimensions, such as A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers. The diagram also shows the location of the cavity.

#### Quadrant assignments for pin 1 orientation in tape

Image /page/5/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a tape with sprocket holes and pocket quadrants. The tape has a series of circular sprocket holes along the top edge. Below the sprocket holes are several square pockets, each divided into four quadrants labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed, and a label points to the pocket quadrants.
