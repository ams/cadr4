On the left side of the component are inputs labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, with corresponding pin numbers (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (1), (2), and (4). On the right side of the component are two outputs. The top output is labeled (5) and "Σ EVEN", and the bottom output is labeled (6) and "Σ ODD".

Pin numbers shown are for D, J, N, and W packages.

#### description

These universal, monolithic, nine-bit parity generators/checkers utilize Schottky-clamped TTL high-performance circuitry and feature odd/even outputs to faciliate operation of either odd or even parity application. The word-length capability is easily expanded by cascading as shown under typical application data.

Series 54LS/74LS and Series 54S/74S parity generators/checkers offer the designer a trade-off between reduced power consumption and high performance. These devices can be used to upgrade the performance of most systems utilizing the '180 parity generator/checker. Although the 'LS280 and 'S280 are implemented without expander inputs, the corresponding function is provided by the availability of an input at pin 4 and the absence of any internal connection at pin 3. This permits the 'LS280 and 'S280 to be substituted for the '180 in existing designs to produce an identical function even if 'LS280's and 'S280's are mixed with existing '180's.

These devices are fully compatible with most other TTL circuits. All 'LS280 and 'S280 inputs are buffered to lower the drive requirements to one Series 54LS/74LS or Series 54S/74S standard load, respectively.

Image /page/4/Figure/3 description: The image shows a complex digital logic circuit diagram. The circuit has nine inputs labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, each with a number in parentheses next to it. The circuit consists of multiple logic gates, including inverters, AND gates, and OR gates. The circuit has two outputs labeled "EVEN" and "ODD", each with a number in parentheses next to it.

Pin numbers shown are for D, J, N, and W packages.

#### TYPICAL APPLICATION DATA

#### 25-LINE PARITY/GENERATOR CHECKER

Three 'LS280's or 'S280's can be used to implement a 25-line parity generator/checker. This arrangement will provide parity in typically 75 or 25 nanoseconds respectively.

Image /page/4/Figure/8 description: The image shows a schematic diagram of three LS280/S280 parity generator/checker circuits. Each circuit has inputs labeled A through I, and outputs labeled EVEN and ODD. The first circuit has an EVEN output. The second circuit has both EVEN and ODD outputs, with labels indicating the output state for high (H) and low (L) input conditions. The third circuit has an EVEN output. Text to the right of the circuits mentions alternative configurations using LS86 exclusive-OR gates for parity applications.

Image /page/4/Figure/9 description: The image contains text describing a generator/checker arrangement that provides parity in typically 75 or 25 nanoseconds respectively.

As an alternative, the outputs of two or three parity generators/checkers can be decoded with a 2-input ('S86 'LS86) or 3-input ('S135) exclusive-OR gate for 18- or 27-line parity applications.

Image /page/4/Figure/11 description: The image shows a diagram of an 81-line parity/generator checker circuit. The circuit consists of three 'LS280/'S280 chips connected in a cascade configuration. Each chip has nine inputs labeled A through I, and two outputs labeled Σ EVEN and Σ ODD. The outputs of the first two chips are connected to the inputs of the third chip. The text in the image states that longer word lengths can be implemented by cascading 'LS280's or 'S280's, and that parity can be generated for word lengths up to 81 bits in typically 75 or 25 nanoseconds respectively. The output of the third chip is labeled H = EVEN, L = ODD, H = ODD, L = EVEN.

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.
