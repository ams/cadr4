#### description

The '283 and 'LS283 adders are electrically and functionally identical to the '83A and 'LS83A, respectively; only the arrangement of the terminals has been changed. The 'S283 high performance versions are also functionally identical.

These improved full adders perform the addition of two 4-bit binary words. The sum  $(\Sigma)$  outputs are provided for each bit and the resultant carry (C4) is obtained from the fourth bit. These adders feature full internal look-ahead across all four bits generating the carry term in ten nanoseconds, typically, for the '283 and 'LS283, and 7.5 nanoseconds for the 'S283. This capability provides the system designer with partial look-ahead performance at the economy and reduced package count of a ripple-carry implementation.

The adder logic, including the carry, is implemented in its true form. End around carry can be accomplished without the need for logic or level inversion.

Series 54. Series 54LS, and Series 54S circuits are characterized for operation over the full temperature range of -55°C to 125°C. Series 74, Series 74LS, and Series 74S circuits are characterized for  $0^{\circ}$ C to  $70^{\circ}$ C operation.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

STRUMENTS

Image /page/8/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The reel diameter is indicated by a vertical arrow spanning the height of the reel. The reel width (W1) is indicated by a horizontal arrow pointing to the width of the reel.

Image /page/8/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions. The diagram includes labels for A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width. B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length. K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness. W is the overall width of the carrier tape. P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers.

#### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/8/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a tape with sprocket holes and pocket quadrants. The tape has a series of circular sprocket holes along the top edge. Below the sprocket holes are several square pockets, each divided into four quadrants labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed. The text "Pocket Quadrants" is written below the pockets, and "Sprocket Holes" is written next to the sprocket holes.
