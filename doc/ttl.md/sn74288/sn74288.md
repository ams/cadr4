# DM54/74S288 (32 x 8) 256-Bit TTL PROM

## General Description

This Schottky memory is organized in the popular 32 words by 8 bits configuration. A memory enable input is provided to control the output states. When the device is enabled, the outputs represent the contents of the selected word. When disabled, the 8 outputs go to the "OFF" or high impedance state.

PROMs are shipped from the factory with lows in all locations. A high may be programmed into any selected location by following the programming instructions.

## Block Diagram

Image /page/0/Figure/14 description: The image shows a block diagram of a memory system. The system consists of a decoder, a 256-bit array memory matrix, an enable buffer, and eight buffers. The decoder has five inputs, labeled A4, A3, A2, A1, and A0. The decoder output is connected to the memory matrix. The memory matrix is a 256-bit array, organized as 32 rows by 8 columns. The enable buffer has one input, labeled G. The enable buffer output is connected to the eight buffers. The eight buffers are labeled Q7, Q6, Q5, Q4, Q3, Q2, Q1, and Q0.

## Functional Description

#### TESTABILITY

The Schottky PROM die includes extra rows and columns of fusable links for testing the programmability of each chip. These test fuses are placed at the worst-case chip locations to provide the highest possible confidence in the programming tests in the final product. A ROM pattern is also permanently fixed in the additional circuitry and coded to provide a parity check of input address levels. These and other test circuits are used to test for correct operation of the row and column-select circuits and functionality of input and enable gates. All test circuits are available at both wafer and assembled device levels to allow 100% functional and parametric testing at every stage of the test flow.

#### RELIABILITY

As with all National products, the Ti-W PROMs are subjected to an on-going reliability evaluation by the Reliability Assurance Department. These evaluations employ accelerated life tests, including dynamic high-temperature operating life, temperature-humidity life, temperature cycling, and thermai shock. To date, nearly 7.4 million Schottky Ti-W PROM device hours have been logged, with samples in Epoxy B molded DIP (N-package), PLCC (V-package) and CERDIP (J-package). Device performance in all package configurations is excellent.

#### TITANIUM-TUNGSTEN FUSES

National's Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs) feature titanium-tungsten (Ti-W) fuse links designed to program efficiently with only 10.5V applied. The high performance and reliability of these PROMs are the result of fabrication by a Schottky bipolar process, of which the titaniumtungsten metalization is an integral part, and the use of an on-chip programming circuit.

A major advantage of the titanium-tungsten fuse technology is the low programming voltage of the fuse links. At 10.5V, this virtually eliminates the need for guard-ring devices and wide spacings required for other fuse technologies. Care is taken, however, to minimize voltage drops across the die and to reduce parasitics. The device is designed to ensure that worst-case fuse operating current is low enough for reliable long-term operation. The Darlington programming circuit is liberally designed to insure adequate power density for blowing the fuse links. The complete circuit design is optimized to provide high performance over the entire operating ranges of  $V_{CC}$  and temperature.
