logic diagram

Image /page/0/Figure/19 description: The image shows a schematic diagram of four NAND gates. Each gate has two inputs labeled A and B, and one output labeled Y. The gates are numbered 1 through 4, with the inputs and outputs labeled accordingly (e.g., 1A, 1B, 1Y, 2A, 2B, 2Y, etc.). The NAND gate symbol is a D-shaped symbol with a small circle at the output, indicating the negation operation.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows: **ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs. **LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect. **NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design. **PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available. **OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption. Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.
