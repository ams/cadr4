#### description

These 8-bit registers feature 3-state outputs designed specifically for driving highly capacitive relatively low-impedance loads. or The high-impedance 3-state and increased high-logic-level drive provide these registers with the capability of being connected directly to and driving the bus lines in a bus-organized system without need for interface or pullup components. These devices are particularly attractive for implementing buffer registers, I/O ports, bidirectional bus drivers, and working registers.

The eight latches of the 'LS373 and 'S373 are transparent D-type latches, meaning that while the enable (C or CLK) input is high, the Q outputs follow the data (D) inputs. When C or CLK is taken low, the output is latched at the level of the data that was set up.

The eight flip-flops of the 'LS374 and 'S374 are edge-triggered D-type flip-flops. On the positive transition of the clock, the Q outputs are set to the logic states that were set up at the D inputs.

Image /page/0/Figure/15 description: The image shows a diagram of an integrated circuit (IC) chip with 20 pins. The chip is labeled with pin names and numbers. On the top side, from left to right, are pins 3, 2, 1 labeled "1D", "1Q", and "OC" respectively. Pin 20 is labeled "Vcc" and pin 19 is labeled "8Q". On the left side, from top to bottom, are pins 4, 5, 6, and 7 labeled "2D", "2Q", "3Q", and "3D" respectively. Pin 8 is labeled "4D". On the bottom side, from left to right, are pins 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 labeled "4Q", "GND", "+", "5Q", and "5D" respectively. On the right side, from top to bottom, are pins 18, 17, 16, 15, and 14 labeled "8D", "7D", "7Q", "6Q", and "6D" respectively.

<sup>†</sup> C for 'LS373 and 'S373; CLK for 'LS374 and 'S374.

Schmitt-trigger buffered inputs at the enable/clock lines of the 'S373 and 'S374 devices simplify system design as ac and dc noise rejection is improved by typically 400 mV due to the input hysteresis. A buffered output-control ( $\overline{\rm OC}$ ) input can be used to place the eight outputs in either a normal logic state (high or low logic levels) or the high-impedance state. In the high-impedance state, the outputs neither load nor drive the bus lines significantly.

 $\overline{\text{OC}}$  does not affect the internal operation of the latches or flip-flops. That is, the old data can be retained or new data can be entered, even while the outputs are off.
