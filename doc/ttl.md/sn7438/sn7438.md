## description

These devices contain four independent 2-input NAND buffer gates with open-collector outputs. The opencollector outputs require pull-up resistors to perform correctly. They may be connected to other opencollector outputs to implement active-low wired-OR or active-high wired-AND functions. Open-collector devices are often used to generate high VOH levels.

The SN5438, SN54LS38, and SN54S38 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55°C to 125°C. The SN7438, SN74LS38, and SN74S38 are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

(3) RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.

(4) Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the column width.

(5) MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is sho Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.

(6) Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the t combined represent the entire part marking for that device.

## TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

STRUMENTS

Image /page/10/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with labels indicating its dimensions. The diagram includes two views of the reel: a front view and a side view. The front view shows the circular shape of the reel with a central hub and spokes extending to the outer rim. A label points to the distance across the circle and reads "Reel Diameter." The side view shows the thickness of the reel. A label points to the thickness and reads "Reel Width (W1)." Above the reel is the title "REEL DIMENSIONS."

Image /page/10/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions. The diagram includes labels for A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers.

## OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/10/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a tape with sprocket holes and pocket quadrants. The tape has a series of circular sprocket holes along the top edge. Below the sprocket holes are pockets, each divided into four quadrants labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed, pointing to the right. The text "Pocket Quadrants" is written below the pockets, with lines pointing to the quadrants.

Image /page/23/Figure/5 description: The image shows a technical drawing of an electronic component, likely an integrated circuit (IC) package. The drawing includes multiple views and dimensions, providing detailed specifications for manufacturing and assembly. The top view shows the outline of the IC with 14 pins on each side, labeled with numbers 1 to 7 on one side and 8 to 14 on the other. The drawing includes dimensions such as '.754-.785 [19.15-19.94]' for the length of the package and '.245-.283 [6.22-7.19]' for the width. The side view shows the pin configuration and dimensions, including '.015-.060 TYP [0.38-1.52]' for the pin length and '.045-.065 [1.15-1.65]' for the pin spacing. The end view shows the pin angle and dimensions, including '.308-.314 [7.83-7.97]' at the gauge plane and '0°-15° TYP' for the pin angle. Other dimensions include '4X .005 MIN [0.13]', '14X .014-.026 [0.36-0.66]', '.010 [0.25] CAB', '.2 MAX TYP [5.08]', and '.13 MIN TYP [3.3]'. The drawing also includes notes and a revision history, with the date '05/2017' and the code '4214771/A'.

CERAMIC DUAL IN LINE PACKAGE

Image /page/24/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a ceramic dual in-line package. The pattern consists of 14 pads on each side, with the first and last pads being square and the rest being circular. The pads are arranged in two parallel rows, with a symmetrical layout. The image includes two detailed views, labeled "DETAIL A" and "DETAIL B", showing the dimensions and construction of the pads. Detail A shows a square pad with a solder mask opening, while Detail B shows a circular pad with a solder mask opening. The image also includes dimensions for the pads and spacing between them. The scale of the land pattern example is 5X, while the scales of Detail A and Detail B are 15X.
