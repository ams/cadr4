### description

These monolithic TTL programmable read-only memories (PROM's) feature titanium-tungsten (Ti-W) fuse links with each link designed to program in one millisecond or less. The Schottky-clamped versions of these PROM's offer considerable flexibility for upgrading existing designs or improving new designs as they feature full Schottky clamping for improved performance, low-current MOS-compatible p-n-p inputs, choice of bus-driving three-state or open-collector outputs, and improved chip-select access times.

The high-complexity 2048- and 4096-bit PROM's can be used to significantly improve system density for fixed memories as all are offered in the 20-pin dual-in-line package having pin-row spacings of 0.300 inch.

#### description (continued)

Data can be electronically programmed, as desired, at any bit location in accordance with the programming procedure specified. All PROM's, except the 'S287 and 'S387, are supplied with a low-logic-level output condition stored at each bit location. The programming procedure open-circuits Ti-W metal links, which reverses the stored logic level at selected locations. The procedure is irreversible; once altered, the output for that bit location is permanently programmed. Outputs never having been altered may later be programmed to supply the opposite output level. Operation of the unit within the recommended operating conditions will not alter the memory content.

A low level at the chip-select input(s) enables each PROM except the '186, which is enabled by a high level at both chip-select inputs. The opposite level at any chip-select input causes the outputs to be off.

The three-state output offers the convenience of an open-collector output with the speed of a totem-pole output; it can be bus-connected to other similar outputs yet it retains the fast rise time characteristic of the TTL totem-pole output. The open-collector output offers the capability of direct interface with a data line having a passive pull-up.

#### step-by-step programming procedure

Programming the SN54186 or SN74186 is performed individually for each of the 512 bit locations and consists basically of applying a current pulse to each output terminal where a low logic level is to be changed to a high (off) level. The power supply and ground connections described below are designed to ensure that alteration of the memory content occurs during the programming procedure only.

- 1. Connect the memory as shown in Figure 1. To address a particular word in the memory, set the input switches to the binary equivalent of that word where a low logic level is as specified under "recommended conditions for programming" and a high logic level is either an open circuit or connection to an open-collector TTL gate with no pull-up resistor.
- 2. Apply a programming current pulse as specified to the pin associated with the first bit to be changed from a low-level to a high-level output.
- 3. Repeat Step 2 for each high-level output desired in the word addressed (program only one bit at a time). Any bit that is to remain at a low level should have its respective output open-circuited during the entire programming cycle for the addressed word.
- 4. Set the next input address and repeat steps 2 and 3 at a programming duty cycle of 35% maximum. This procedure is repeated for each input address for which a specific output word pattern is desired. A low logic level can always be changed to a high logic level simply by repeating Steps 1 and 2. Once programmed to provide a high logic level, the output cannot be changed to supply a low logic level.
- NOTE: When verification indicates that a bit did not program, repeat steps 2 through 4. If the bit did not program after the second application of a 1-millisecond programming pulse, repeat steps 2 through 4 using programming pulse time of 10 to 20 milliseconds. Regardless of the programming pulse duration, its total average pulse time should be no more than 35% of the programming cycle.

TES: 6. Voltage values are with respect to the GND 2 terminals.

NOTES: 6. Voltage values are with respect to the GND 2 terminals.<br>7. The '188A, 'S188, 'S288, 'S470, 'S471, 'S472, and 'S473 are supplied with all bit locations containing a low logic level, and<br>programming a bit changes t high logic level, and programming a bit changes it to a low logic level.

8. Programming is guaranteed if the pulse applied is 10 ms long. Typically, programming occurs in 1 ms.

#### step-by-step programming procedure

- 1. Apply steady-state supply voltage ( $V_{CC} = 5 \text{ V}$ ) and address the word to be programmed.
- 2. Verify that the bit location needs to be programmed. If not, proceed to the next bit.
- 3. If the bit requires programming, disable the outputs by applying a high-logic-level voltage to the chip-select input(s).
- 4. Only one bit location is programmed at a time. Connect each output not being programmed to 5 V through 3.9 k $\Omega$ and apply the voltage specified in the table to the output to be programmed. Maximum current out of the programming output supply during programming is 150 mA.
- 5. Step V<sub>CC</sub> to 10.5 V nominal. Maximum supply current required during programming is 750 mA.
- 6. Apply a low-logic-level voltage to the chip-select input(s). This should occur between 10  $\mu$ s and 1 ms after V<sub>CC</sub> has reached its 10.5-V level. See programming sequence of Figure 3.
- 7. After the X pulse time (1 ms) is reached, a high logic level is applied to the chip-select inputs to disable the outputs.
- 8. Within 10  $\mu$ s to 1 ms after the chip-select input(s) reach a high logic level, V<sub>CC</sub> should be stepped down to 5 V at which level verification can be accomplished.
- 9. The chip-select input(s) may be taken to a low logic level (to permit program verification) 10  $\mu$ s or more after V<sub>CC</sub> reaches its steady-state value of 5 V.
- 10. At a Y pulse duty cycle of 35% or less, repeat steps 1 through 8 for each output where it is desired to program a hit.
- NOTES: A) V<sub>CC</sub> should be removed between program pulses to reduce dissipation and chip temperatures. See Figure 3. B) When verification indicates that a bit did not program, repeat steps 3 through 9. If the bit did not program after the
  - second application of a 1-ms X pulse, repeat steps 3 through 9 using an X pulse time of 10 to 20 ms. Regardless of the X duration, the total average pulse time of Y should be no more than 35% of the programming cycle.

Image /page/3/Figure/20 description: The image shows two diagrams. The first diagram is a simple circuit with a 5V source connected to a resistor of 3.9 kΩ, with the output taken after the resistor. Below the circuit, the text reads "LOAD CIRCUIT FOR EACH OUTPUT NOT BEING PROGRAMMED OR FOR PROGRAM VERIFICATION FIGURE 2". The second diagram is a timing diagram with three signals: "VERIFY NEED TO PROGRAM", "VCC", and "CS". The "VERIFY NEED TO PROGRAM" signal starts at 5V, rises to 10.5V, stays there for a duration labeled "Y", and then returns to 5V. The "VCC" signal starts at 0V, rises to 5V, stays there for a duration labeled "X", and then returns to 0V. The diagram also indicates that VCC is removed to reduce average power. The "CS" signal starts at a low level (VIL), goes high (VIH) for a short duration when VCC rises, and then returns to VIL. The diagram labels the rising edge of CS as "APPLY VO(pr)" and the falling edge as "REMOVE VO(pr)". The time duration for the rising and falling edges of VCC is labeled as "10 μs to 1 ms".

## SERIES 54/74. 54S/74S PROGRAMMABLE READ-ONLY MEMORIES

Image /page/7/Figure/1 description: The image shows parameter measurement information, including a load circuit and voltage waveforms. The load circuit consists of a voltage source VCC, a resistor RL1 with a value of 300 ohms, a capacitor CL with a value of 30 pF, and a resistor RL2 with a value of 600 ohms. The voltage waveforms show the timing diagrams for the chip select input(s), address inputs, and output. The chip select input(s) have two signals, CS and CS, which transition between 0V and 3V with a threshold of 1.5V. The address inputs also transition between 0V and 3V with a threshold of 1.5V. The output transitions between VOL and VOH with a threshold of 1.5V. The timing parameters ta(CS), ta(ad), and tPLH are also shown in the voltage waveforms.

- NOTES: A. The input pulse generator has the following characteristics: Z<sub>out</sub>  $\approx$  50  $\Omega$  and PRR  $\leq$  1 MHz. For Series 54/74, t<sub>r</sub>  $\leq$  7 ns,  $t_f \leqslant 7$  ns. For Series 54S/74S,  $t_f \leqslant 2.5$  ns,  $t_f \leqslant 2.5$  ns.
  - B.  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{L}}$  includes probe and jig capacitance.
  - C. The pulse generator is connected to the input under test. The other inputs, memory content permitting, are connected so that the input will switch the output under test.

Image /page/7/Figure/5 description: The image shows two circuit diagrams and voltage waveforms. The first circuit diagram is a load circuit with a test point, a VCC, switches S1 and S2, a resistor RL of 300 ohms, a 1k ohm resistor, a capacitor CL, and several diodes. The second diagram shows address inputs, output, chip-select inputs, waveform 1, and waveform 2. The voltage waveforms show access time from address inputs and access (enable) time and disable time from chip select. The waveforms show voltage levels of 3V, 1.5V, 0V, VOH, VOL, tPLZ, tPHZ, and tPXZ.
