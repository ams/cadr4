### description

The '51 and 'S51 contain two independent 2-wide 2-input AND-OR-INVERT gates. They perform the Boolean function  $Y = \overline{AB + CD}$ .

The 'LS51 contains one 2-wide 3-input and one 2-wide 2-input AND-OR-INVERT gates. They perform the Boolean functions  $1Y = \overline{(1A \cdot 1B \cdot 1C) + (1D \cdot 1E \cdot 1F)}$  and  $2Y = \overline{(2A \cdot 2B) + (2C \cdot 2D)}$ .The SN5451, SN54LS51, and SN54S51 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55°C to 125°C. The SN7451, SN74LS51 and SN74S51 are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS**: TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.
