#### description

These devices contain 4-2-3-2 input AND-OR-INVERT gates. They perform the Boolean function  $Y = \overline{ABCD + EF + GHI + JK}$ . The 'S64 has totem-pole outputs and the 'S65 has open-collector outputs.

The SN54S64 and the SN54S65 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of  $-$  55 °C to 125 °C. The SN74S64 and the SN74S65 are characterized for operation from 0 °C to 70 °C.

### logic symbols<sup>†</sup>

Image /page/0/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a 'S64' logic gate. The inputs are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, with corresponding pin numbers (1), (11), (12), (13), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (9), and (10). There are four AND gates labeled with the '&' symbol. The output is labeled Y with pin number (8). The final gate is an OR gate labeled with the '≥1' symbol.

Image /page/0/Figure/8 description: The image shows a logic gate diagram labeled 'S65. On the left side are inputs A through K, each with a pin number in parentheses. A is connected to pin 1, B to 11, C to 12, D to 13, E to 2, F to 3, G to 4, H to 5, I to 6, J to 9, and K to 10. The inputs are fed into a series of AND gates, indicated by the '&' symbol. The outputs of these AND gates are then fed into an OR gate, indicated by the '≥1' symbol. The output of the OR gate is labeled 'Y' and is connected to pin 8. There is also a small diamond shape on the output line, indicating that the output is inverted.

<sup>†</sup>These symbols are in accordance with ANSI/IEEE Std 91-1984 and IEC Publication 617-12.

Pin numbers shown are for D, J, N, and W packages.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.
