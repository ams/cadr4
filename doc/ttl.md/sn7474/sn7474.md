#### description

These devices contain two independent D-type positive-edge-triggered flip-flops. A low level at the preset or clear inputs sets or resets the outputs regardless of the levels of the other inputs. When preset and clear are inactive (high), data at the D input meeting the setup time requirements are transferred to the outputs on the positive-going edge of the clock pulse. Clock triggering occurs at a voltage level and is not directly related to the rise time of the clock pulse. Following the hold time interval, data at the D input may be changed without affecting the levels at the outputs.

The SN54' family is characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of  $-55^{\circ}$ C to  $125^{\circ}$ C. The SN74' family is characterized for operation from 0 °C to 70 °C.

<sup>†</sup> The output levels in this configuration are not guaranteed to meet the minimum levels in  $\mathbf{V}_{\mbox{OH}}$  if the lows at preset and clear are near VIL maximum. Furthermore, this configuration is nonstable; that is, it will not persist when either preset or clear returns to its inactive (high) level.

NOTE 4: For certain devices where state commutation can be caused by shorting an output to ground, an equivalent test may be performed with  $V_O = 2.25$  V and 2.125 V for the 54 family and the 74 family, respectively, with the minimum and maximum limits reduced to one half of their stated values.

<sup>†</sup>For conditions shown as MIN or MAX, use the appropriate value specified under recommended operating conditions.

<sup>‡</sup>All typical values are at  $V_{CC} = 5 \text{ V}$ ,  $T_A = 25 \text{ }^{\circ}\text{C}$ .§Not more than one output should be shorted at a time, and the duration of the short circuit should not exceed one second.

Clear is tested with preset high and preset is tested with clear high.

#Average per flip-flop.

NOTE 2: With all outputs open, I<sub>CC</sub> is measured with the Q and  $\overline{\text{Q}}$  outputs high in turn. At the time of measurement, the clock input is grounded.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows: **ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

**NRND:** Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

RoHS Exempt: TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

The reel diameter is labeled with an arrow pointing to the diameter of the reel. The reel width (W1) is labeled with an arrow pointing to the width of the reel.

Image /page/11/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions for a component carrier tape. The diagram includes labels for various dimensions, such as A0, B0, K0, W, and P1. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers. The diagram also shows the location of the cavity in the tape.

#### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/11/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a tape with sprocket holes and pockets divided into quadrants. The sprocket holes are located along the top edge of the tape. The pockets are arranged in a row along the center of the tape. Each pocket is divided into four quadrants, labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed. The text "Pocket Quadrants" is written below the pockets.

CERAMIC DUAL IN LINE PACKAGE

Image /page/19/Figure/4 description: The image shows a land pattern example for a ceramic dual in-line package. The pattern consists of 14 pads on each side, with the pads on each side being symmetrical. The pads are arranged in a line, with a spacing of 0.100 inches (2.54 mm) between each pad. The pads are 0.039 inches (1 mm) in diameter. The land pattern example is non-solder mask defined and is shown at a scale of 5X. There are also two detailed views of the pads, labeled "DETAIL A" and "DETAIL B". Detail A shows a square pad with a solder mask opening, and Detail B shows a circular pad with a solder mask opening. The details are shown at scales of 15X and 13X, respectively.
