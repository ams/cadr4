### description

These devices contain four independent 2-input Exclusive-OR gates. They perform the Boolean functions  $Y = A \oplus B = \overline{AB} + \overline{AB}$  in positive logic.

A common application is as a true/complement element. If one of the inputs is low, the other input will be reproduced in true form at the output. If one of the inputs is high, the signal on the other input will be reproduced inverted at the output.

The SN5486, 54LS86A, and the SN54S86 are characterized for operation over the full military temperature range of -55°C to 125°C. The SN7486, SN74LS86A, and the SN74S86 are characterized for operation from 0°C to 70°C.

### exclusive-OR logic

An exclusive-OR gate has many applications, some of which can be represented better by alternative logic symbols.

Image /page/0/Figure/10 description: The image shows five different logic gate symbols. From left to right, they are: a buffer gate, an OR gate, an AND gate, a NOR gate, and a NAND gate.

**EXCLUSIVE-OR** 

These are five equivalent Exclusive-OR symbols valid for an '86 or 'LS86A gate in positive logic; negation may be shown at any two ports.

LOGIC IDENTITY ELEMENT

Image /page/0/Figure/13 description: The image shows a schematic symbol of a device with two input lines on the left side of a rectangular box and one output line on the right side of the box. The output line has a small triangle pointing towards the box.

The output is active (low) if all inputs stand at the same logic level (i.e.,  $A = B$ ).

**EVEN-PARITY** 

Image /page/0/Figure/16 description: The image shows a schematic diagram of a 2k resistor. The resistor is represented by a rectangle with the text '2k' inside. Two horizontal lines are connected to the left side of the rectangle, and a line with an arrow is connected to the right side.

The output is active (low) if an even number of inputs (i.e., 0 or 2) are active.

ODD-PARITY ELEMENT

Image /page/0/Figure/19 description: The image shows a rectangle with the expression "2k + 1" written inside. There are two horizontal lines on the left side of the rectangle and one horizontal line on the right side.

The output is active (high) if an odd number of inputs (i.e., only 1 of the 2) are active.

(1) The marketing status values are defined as follows:

**ACTIVE:** Product device recommended for new designs.

**LIFEBUY:** TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a lifetime-buy period is in effect.

NRND: Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part in a new design.

**PREVIEW:** Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples may or may not be available.

**OBSOLETE:** TI has discontinued the production of the device.

(2) **RoHS:** TI defines "RoHS" to mean semiconductor products that are compliant with the current EU RoHS requirements for all 10 RoHS substances, including the requirement that RoHS substance do not exceed 0.1% by weight in homogeneous materials. Where designed to be soldered at high temperatures, "RoHS" products are suitable for use in specified lead-free processes. TI may reference these types of products as "Pb-Free".

**RoHS Exempt:** TI defines "RoHS Exempt" to mean products that contain lead but are compliant with EU RoHS pursuant to a specific EU RoHS exemption.

Green: TI defines "Green" to mean the content of Chlorine (CI) and Bromine (Br) based flame retardants meet JS709B low halogen requirements of <=1000ppm threshold. Antimony trioxide based flame retardants must also meet the  $\leq$ =1000ppm threshold requirement.

(3) MSL, Peak Temp. - The Moisture Sensitivity Level rating according to the JEDEC industry standard classifications, and peak solder temperature.

(4) There may be additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category on the device.

(5) Multiple Device Markings will be inside parentheses. Only one Device Marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a device. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire Device Marking for that device.

(6) Lead finish/Ball material - Orderable Devices may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

Image /page/8/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Texas Instruments. On the left is a red icon that resembles the state of Texas with the letters 'ti' inside. To the right of the icon is the text 'TEXAS INSTRUMENTS' in a simple, sans-serif font.

### TAPE AND REEL INFORMATION

STRUMENTS

Image /page/9/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of a reel with dimensions labeled. The diagram includes a top view of the reel, showing its circular shape and internal structure, and a side view, illustrating its width. Arrows point to the reel's diameter and width, with the labels "Reel Diameter" and "Reel Width (W1)" respectively. The diagram is titled "REEL DIMENSIONS".

Image /page/9/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of tape dimensions. The diagram includes labels for A0, B0, K0, W, and P1, which are defined in a table below the diagram. A0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component width, B0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component length, K0 is the dimension designed to accommodate the component thickness, W is the overall width of the carrier tape, and P1 is the pitch between successive cavity centers.

### OUADRANT ASSIGNMENTS FOR PIN 1 ORIENTATION IN TAPE

Image /page/9/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of a tape with sprocket holes along the top edge. There are three pockets shown, each divided into four quadrants labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. An arrow indicates the user direction of feed, and a label points to the pocket quadrants.
