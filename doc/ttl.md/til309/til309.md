### description

These internally-driven seven-segment light-emitting-diode (LED) displays contain a five-bit latch and a decoder/LED driver in a single 16-pin package. A description of the functions of the inputs and outputs of these devices are in the terminal function table.

The TTL MSI circuits contain the equivalent of 78 gates on a single chip. Logic inputs and outputs are completely TTL/DTL compatible. The buffered inputs are implemented with relatively large resistors in series with the bases of the input transistors to lower drive-current requirements to one-half of that required for a standard Series 54/74 TTL input.

Some of the additional features of these displays are as follows:

- $\bullet$ Latched BCD and decimal point logic outputs provided to drive logic processors simultaneously with the displayed data
- $\bullet$ Minimum number of inputs required . . . 4-line BCD plus decimal point
- Overriding blanking for suppressing entire display or pulse-modulation of LED brightness .
- $\bullet$ LED test input to simultaneously turn on all display segments and decimal point
- Can be operated in a real-time mode or latched-update-only mode by use of the latch strobe input  $\bullet$
- Displays numbers 0 through 9 as well as A, C, E, F, or minus sign  $\bullet$
- $\bullet$ Can be blanked by entry of BCD 13 or by use of the blanking input
- Decimal point controlled independently with decimal-point latch  $\bullet$
- $\bullet$ Constant-current-source TTL-LED interface for optimum performance.

The latch outputs except  $Q_{DP}$  are active pullup, and each one, except  $Q_{DP}$ , is capable of driving three standard Series 54/74 loads. The LED driver outputs are designed specifically to maintain a relatively constant on-level current of approximately 7 mA through each LED segment and decimal point. All inputs are diode-clamped to minimize transmission-line effects, thereby simplifying system design. Power dissipation is typically 575 mW with all segments on.

## electrical characteristics at 25°C case temperature

 $\overline{\dagger}$  All typical values are at V<sub>CC</sub> = 5 V.

NOTES: 3. This parameter is measured with the display blanked.

4. Luminous intensity is measured with a light sensor and filter combination that approximates the CIE (International Commission on Illumination) eye-response curve.

5. These parameters are measured with all LED segments and the decimal point on.

Image /page/5/Figure/2 description: The image contains two plots. The plot on the left is titled "RELATIVE SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS" and shows the relative luminous intensity as a function of wavelength. The x-axis is labeled "λ – Wavelength - nm" and ranges from 600 to 700. The y-axis is labeled "Relative Luminous Intensity" and ranges from 0 to 1. The plot shows a peak at around 660 nm. The plot also indicates that VCC = 5 V and TC = 25°C. The plot on the right is titled "RELATIVE LUMINOUS INTENSITY VS CASE TEMPERATURE" and shows the luminous intensity relative to value at TC = 25°C as a function of TC - Case Temperature - °C. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 70. The y-axis ranges from 0.1 to 4. The plot shows a decreasing trend as the temperature increases. The plot also indicates that VCC = 5 V.
