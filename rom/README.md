promh9.* files (see doc/ai/lispm1) come from the 24 Feb 1981 tape. These are converted to their hex format with `convert_prom_to_hex.py`. These match to promh.mcr.9 i-mem contents. These are for PROM0 only. PROM1 does not contain any data and loaded with prom.zeroes.hex file containing only zeroes with correct parity.
