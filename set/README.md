# set

This folder contains set components. A set component consists of more than one cadr components. It makes life easier to use these since some components use only signals among them (e.g. pctl+prom0+prom1)

The set components are named without a prefix or suffix. For example, prom set component is called prom and it uses cadr_pctl, cadr_prom0 and cadr_prom1.
